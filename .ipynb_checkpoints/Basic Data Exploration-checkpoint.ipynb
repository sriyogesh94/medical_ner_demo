History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nNone\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThis is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\\nThere were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\\nShe had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\\nThe patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\\nThe weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\\nHer appetite was gone .\\nShe was having some nausea .\\nNo recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\\nNo changes in her breathing .\\nShe did not seem sleepy or confused .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\\nWeight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\\nTemperature 97 .\\nThe patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\\nShe could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\\nShe has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nheart ; without murmur or gallop .\\nHer jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\\nsoft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nShe had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\\nShe was moving all four extremities .\\nHer cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nHematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\\nOver the following days , she was gently hydrated .\\nHer urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\\nShe was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\\nIn the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\\nShe tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\\nThe patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\\nThe family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\\nThey did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\\nBy the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\\nOn the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\\nThere had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\\nPotassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\\nShe was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\\nThe problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\\nThe patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\\nThe patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\\nShe will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\\n2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\\nshe also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\\n5.

.\\nMr. Kulrinne has a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity .\\nHe had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall .\\nHe was placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .\\nOn medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .\\nAn attempt at medical management was continued .\\nHowever , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission

.\\nNo significant murmurs .\\nAbdomen :\\nObese and soft .\\nExtremities :\\nWithout edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .\\nHe became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHowever , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nIn the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\\nHe was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\\nHe was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\\nThe circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\\nThe right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\\nA balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\\nThe patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\\nThe procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\\nThe distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\\nA good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\\nHis peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\\nThe patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\\nHe underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\\nIn addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\\nIt was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\\nIn addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\\nHead CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\\nIn addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\\nThe patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\\nThis was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\\nHe tolerated it well .\\nThe ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\\nThe patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHe had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\\nHe was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\\nHe is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\\nAt the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\\nHe has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\\nOf note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\\nElectronically Signed RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D. 02/17/2002 11:29\\n_____________________________ RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nfb\\nDD :\\n02/06/2002\\nTD

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

:\\n4-13-93\\nDIAGNOSES :\\nAortic stenosis .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nStenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\n4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .\\n4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .\\nThis involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .\\nHe did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .\\nHe underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .\\nFollowing this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .\\nOver the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .\\nHe also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .\\nThe patient was referred here for further evaluation .\\nMr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .\\nThe blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .\\nThere were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .\\nThere was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .\\nThe cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .\\nThere was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .\\nThe liver was not palpable .\\nThere were diminished pulses in the legs .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .\\nThe electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .\\nThe chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nI indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\\nAccordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\\nThe study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\\nThe right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\\nUsing transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\\nThe left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\\nAn attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\\nOn April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\\nAt the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\\nThere was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\\nI have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\\nThe valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\\nThe surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\\nMr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .\\nHe had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .\\nHe seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .\\nThere was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .\\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .\\nThe patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .\\nThe heart appeared to be flaccid .\\nWe really have no good explanation of what this was all about .\\nHe was being treated for a possible pneumonia .\\nHe did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .\\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .\\nThe patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .\\nA post mortem examination will be performed .\\nTAARNNA LANCELOILNEG , M.D.\\nTR :\\nra /

( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nRemarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .\\nHis pulse exam was intact .\\nCardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .\\nThere was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .\\nA patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .\\nAlso of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .\\nPost-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .\\nHe remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .\\nTransthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .\\nThe next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .\\nThe patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nIn the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .\\nOn December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .\\nThe total bypass time :\\n2 hours 25 minutes .\\nTotal crossclamp time :\\n1 hour and 48 minutes .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .\\nThe patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .\\nChest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .\\nAggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .\\nIn addition , he remained agitated .\\nThis was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .\\nOn day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .\\nHis urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .\\nDespite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .\\nHe required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .\\nHe received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .\\nVery early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .\\nWith positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .\\nThroughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .\\nException was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .\\nHis chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .\\nInfectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nCardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\\nConsequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\\nIn addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\\nOn the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\\nOn 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\\nIt was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\\nAt approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\\nThe patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\\nWithin one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\\nThe patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\\nThe patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\\nThe chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\\nCompressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\\nThe patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .\\nFurther attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\\nThe family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbp / bmot\\nDD :\\n12/17/93\\nTD :\\n12/18/93\\nCC :\\nG Hemp , M.D. Taarnna Has , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

Medical Center because of alleged intractible ascites .\\nThe patient had a history of post tranfusion hepatitis to twenty years duration , allegedly due to hepatitis C , and had previously failed therapy with Prednisone , and also Interferon .\\nShe had been known to have chronic liver disease , X 12 years .\\nIn the fall she began to have episodes of seizures associated with asystole , and for this reason had recently had a pacemaker implanted .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Iming Medical Center in February and March of 1992 , on Mar 20 , 1992 , a permanent BVI pacemaker was

without sign of obstruction on 4/17/92 .\\nGaited blood pool scan on 4/18/92 shows slight decrease left ventricular function with an LVEF of 45% , minimal wall motion abnormalities confined to a small zone of the apex .\\nPersantine Thallium study , no definite evidence of ischemia or infarction .\\nAbdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography showed cirrhotic liver with markedly enlarged portal vein and recannulization of the umbilical vein prominent acidic fluid in the abdomen , moderate splenomegaly , right renal cyst , status post hysterectomy .\\nelectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia , first degree AV block , left axis deviation .\\nAt the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for two days and then switched to Unasyn 3 grams per day .\\nThe patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy .\\nThe patient was evaluated for long term therapy .\\nThe patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with Aldactone and Lasix .\\nMarked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several days .\\nBecause of the patient 's history of asystole , she was discussed with Dr. White as a possible transplant candidate .\\nHe felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out .\\nFor that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45% ejection fraction .\\nA Persantine Thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia .\\nHer diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting .\\nThe patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by Dr. White , who felt , although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function .\\nAn upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4/23/92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus .\\nMeanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells , with no preponderance of polys .\\nThe patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds .\\nAt the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued , and an optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to be between 126 and 128 .\\nThis period of time there was a brief increase in her SGOT from the 100 's to 230 .\\nShe was discharged home on 5/5/92 on the following program .\\n1600 calorie ADA diet .\\nNo free water , no added salt , 60 gram protein diet .\\nTegretol 200 mg. d

or S4 , a grade II / VI systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a flow murmur .\\nNo peripheral edema was noted .\\nThe jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place .\\nThe carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally .\\nThe vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants .\\nIt was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness .\\nHe had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and no masses were felt .\\nThe genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender .\\nThere was no urethritis , no balinitis , normal prostate , nontender .\\nThere was tan guaiac positive stool with no masses .\\nThe musculoskeletal exam showed well developed ,

.\\nThe sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam .\\nReflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .\\nThe SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .\\nLactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .\\nHematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .\\nThe MCV is 88 .\\nThe prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .\\nThe urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .\\nThe CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .\\nThe urine sodium was 147 .\\nThe serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .\\nAn I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .\\nThe abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .\\nChest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .\\nHe was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .\\n1-Rhabdomyolysis .\\nThe patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .\\nThis resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .\\nThe patient \\'s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .\\nThe aldolase was positive at 142 .\\nThis was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .\\nThe patient \\'s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .\\nThe patient \\'s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .\\nNevertheless , the patient \\'s renal failure continued to progress .\\nOver the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .\\nMuch of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .\\n2-Renal failure .\\nThe creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .\\nThe urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .\\nPeritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .\\nSubsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .\\nHe continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .\\n3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .\\nOn admission the patient \\'s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .\\nHe went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .\\nThe patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .\\nHis DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .\\n4-Septic shock .\\nThe patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\\nThis will be discussed below .\\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\\n5-Hepatic failure .\\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .\\nGiven his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .\\n6-Cocaine intoxication .\\nSerum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .\\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .\\n7-Pneumonia .\\nThe patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .\\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .\\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\\n8-Pancreatitis .\\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\\n9-Catheter tip infections .\\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\\n10-Anemia .\\nThe patient \\'s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\\n11-Coma .\\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient \\'s persistent coagulopathy .\\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nCocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .\\nCOMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :\\nNeck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nNone .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient was discharged to Samfer Street with no autopsy .\\nLENNI HEAD , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbe

History of M. kansasaii with workup by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital proceeding currently .\\n# 3. History of breast cancer .\\nIn December 1990 she had a lumpectomy , from left breast , and XRT x 35 .\\nNo axillary dissection was done because she was status post MI .\\nShe received Tamoxifen briefly .\\nMammogram was normal 7/92 , and 5/92 .\\nShe is allergic to Amoxicillin , having developed a rash , does not smoke , does not drink .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nDyazide one p.o. q.d.

Glaucoma drops .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 118/75 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 , in no acute distress .\\nHead and neck exam was unremarkable , except for the right eye being patched over .\\nLungs were clear .\\nBreasts were unremarkable .\\nBack was nontender .\\nHeart exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm , jugular venous pressure was normal , no carotid bruit was noted ; murmur , rub , gallop , click and ectopy were absent .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nRectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithout clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis .\\nNormal pulses were palpated .\\nNeurologic exam :\\nthe patient was alert and oriented x 4 .\\nExtensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes .\\nThere was a touch an anosognosia .\\nCranial nerve exam :\\nvisual fields were full o.s. , visual acuity was 20/70 o.s.\\nPupil o.s. reacted to light .\\nEOMs with full range of movement , no nystagmus .\\nVIIth cranial nerve :\\ninferior left weak .\\nNo gag was present .\\nOtherwise normal CN 's .\\nDTRs showed a mild decrease in left biceps and brachioradialis reflexes , otherwise normal tone , symmetrical reflexes , downgoing toes .\\nMotor exam :\\n5+ throughout , except left hand intrinsic muscles were 4+ , 3+ in the middle digits .\\nNo atrophy was noted .\\nSensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception .\\nCerebellar exam :\\nfinger / to/nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel-to-shin was good with few errors .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nChest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities .\\nEKG :\\nleft bundle branch block .\\nUrinalysis was unremarkable .\\nBUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .\\nHer admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .\\nAlbumin 2.5 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\\nThis was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\\nThe possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\\nHer echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\\nPrevious echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .\\nHer Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .\\nThe patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .\\nShe was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .\\nHer exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .\\nHer pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .\\nShe needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .\\nIn addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .\\nIt is discontinued at the time of transport .\\nThe patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\\nDuring evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\\nOn our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\\nThere are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\\nAt the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\\nWhat follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\\nHer ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\\nMoreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\\nOur leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\\nAs I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\\nWhile mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\\nTwo possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\\nThese tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\\nThe patient has glaucoma .\\nHer medications are as listed below .\\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nPropanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d.

dilated cardiomyopathy with history of intra-atrial thrombus .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nUndergone during this hospital admission was a left brachial artery embolectomy .\\nThe patient also underwent upper endoscopy and a left wrist fine needle aspiration .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 76 year old white male with a probable brachial artery embolism .\\nThe patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was previously on Coumadin because of a prior embolic cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient had his Coumadin discontinued in January 1992 secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nThe patient was swimming at 4:00 o 'clock this afternoon when he experienced left upper extremity pain and paralysis .\\nHe was evaluated at Sephsandpot Center and referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for evaluation .\\nThe patient is righthanded .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. cardiomyopathy .\\n2. atrial fibrillation .\\n3.

EXAMINATION :\\n( at time of admission ) the systolic blood pressure is 180 , his head and neck examination within normal limits .\\nCardiac :\\nhe has a II out of VI systolic ejection murmur which is loudest at the right upper sternal border .\\nHis chest is clear .\\nHis abdomen was benign .\\nHis rectal examination guaiac negative .\\nOf greatest note on his pulse examination :\\nhis carotid , femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2 plus both right and left .\\nHis subclavian artery and axillary artery pulses are 2 plus bilaterally .\\nHis brachial pulse is 2 plus , radial pulse 2 plus and ulnar pulse 2 plus on the right .\\nOn the left he has no brachial , no radial and no ulnar pulse .\\nHis left hand and arm strength is 4/4 with decreased sensation in the left fingers in the median and ulnar distribution .\\nThe impression :\\na probable brachial artery embolus .\\nThe plan is to perform an urgent embolectomy .\\nThe risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent has been obtained .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room .\\nThe preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .\\nThe postoperative diagnosis , the same .\\nThe procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .\\nThe surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .\\nThe findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .\\nThere were no complications .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .\\nOn postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .\\nHe was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .\\nIn addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .\\nThe patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\\nHis assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nHe recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\\nThese recommendations were already underway .\\nConsequently we simply continued our management .\\nThe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\\nOn 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\\nDr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nDuring this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\\nHe had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\\nFollow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\\nThere was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .\\nThe stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .\\nFrom Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .\\nWe discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\\nIt was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\\nThat was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\\nGiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\\nThe findings were as follows .\\nThe principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\\nThe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .\\nIn the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\\nThere were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\\nThe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\\nNo biopsy was taken .\\nThe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\\nOn 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\\nFindings were :\\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\\nThere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\\nThe aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\\nThere was trace aortic insufficiency .\\nThe aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\\nThe left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a

insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\\nThere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\\nThe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\\nHe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\\nOn 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\\nHe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\\nThe Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\\nJoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\\nJoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\\nThe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\\nA wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\\nThe patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\\nHe is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\\nToday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\\nYesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\\nToday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\\nConsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\\nThe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nIsordil 10 mg.

Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .\\nAt that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .\\nThe admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .\\nThe patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .\\nOne month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .\\nThereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .\\nThis course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .\\nAn abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nBilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .\\nTwo days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .\\nOn this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .\\nShe was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs as detailed above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nShe is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .\\nALLERGIES :\\nShe is allergic to shellfish .\\nDRUG ALLERGIES :\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nInclude Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\n( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .\\nShe was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .\\nHead and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .\\nShe had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .\\nAbdomen :\\nshowed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nPelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .\\nThe patient was occult blood negative .\\nExtremities :\\nshowed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .\\nHowever , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\n( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .\\nI and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\\nChest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nThe patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\\nShe also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\\nIt was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\\nLaboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\\nUrinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\\nIn view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\\nRepeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\\nRenal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\\nDr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\\nHe requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\\nNeither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\\nIn view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\\nAs a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\\nShe was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\\nSputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\\nOn the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\\nHer urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\\nHowever , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\\nOn 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\\nHer Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\\nOn June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\\nShe was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\\nIn view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\\nOn 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\\nUrinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\\nA Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\\nAn electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\\nNo computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\\nShe continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\\nOff her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\\nFor this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\\nThe mucosa appeared to be preserved .\\nIn addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\\nThe patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\\nThe patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\\nHer sensorium had cleared .\\nBecause of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .\\nThe patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\\nIn addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\\nDespite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\\nA Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\\nOn conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\\nAnd she was not given platelets in addition .\\nThroughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .\\nAfter much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .\\nOn August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .\\nOn June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .\\nThe PEG tube was found to be draining well .\\nShe was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .\\nThe patient 's prognosis is guarded .\\nHer current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nInclude omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.\\nShe will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nThe patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .\\nLONGKEND SAPSHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nSLAINEAEE S.

alcohol ingestion .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .\\nChest was clear .\\nHeart had regular rate and rhythm .\\nNeck was supple without mass or bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nCalves were nontender .\\nOn neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .\\nShe looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .\\nHer face was strong and symmetric .\\nShe felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .\\nHer extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .\\nShe sees light only od. which is chronic .\\nShe reads large print os.\\nHer tongue was midline and her palate

plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .\\nA head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .\\nMRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .\\nThis revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .\\nThis was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nThe internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .\\nAfter much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .\\nThe patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .\\nThis showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .\\nOne coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nIt was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .\\nAlso the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .\\nTherefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .\\nTherefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .\\nAt this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .\\nTherefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .\\nThe patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .\\nHer pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .\\nHer consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nPROCEDURES :\\nOn 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .\\n01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\n01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nThere were no noted complications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\ninclude heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. ,

Chest CT scan .\\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\\nNone .\\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\\nNone .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\\nOver the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\\nHe has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\\nAlthough in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\\nThe patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\\nHe has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\\nHe does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nOn examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nHis blood pressure was 110/70 .\\nHeart was 82 and regular .\\nRespiratory rate was 16 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\\nLungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\\nThe first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\\nThere was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nThere was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\\nThe extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\\nThe posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\\nAlbumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\\nThe chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\\nThe ECG was paced .\\nAn outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\\nThere was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\\nThe aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\\nThere was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\\nIn addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\\nWhile in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\\nThe patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\\nThe patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\\nIn addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\\nHe will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1.

.\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\nVQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .\\nIn the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .\\nUpon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\\nIn addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\\nThe patient lives on Quelene with his wife .\\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\\nMr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\\nThere was no thyromegaly .\\nCarotids were 2+ .\\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\\nThe urinalysis was negative .\\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nImdur 120 mg.

arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. Bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in December , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\\nIn addition , Mr. Bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\\nThe patient lives on Ewi with his wife .\\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\\nMr. Bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\\nThere was no thyromegaly .\\nCarotids were 2+ .\\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\\nThe urinalysis was negative .\\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. Fraction within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nImdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

OPERATIONS :\\n10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .\\nShe was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nAtenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d.

and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .\\nIt was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .\\nHowever , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .\\nThe patient tolerated the initial procedure well .\\nOn the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .\\nShe was awake and following commands .\\nIt was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .\\nThe patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past

pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .\\nSince that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .\\nHer current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .\\nHer prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .\\nThe patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .\\nWe feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nCoumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .\\nHer dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .\\nOther medications include :\\nIsordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .\\nThe patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .\\nAdditionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient is transferred to Villrow Health .\\nShe should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .\\nShe should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .\\nShe will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .\\nDALYWOO DROREITE , M.D.\\nTR :\\niq / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-4-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC

the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\\nFor a short time , she seemed \" locked in \" .\\nShe has

, the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient \\'s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient \\'s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nCoronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\\nHABITS :\\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\\nThere was no splenomegaly .\\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nyf / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-3-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Swatlleebtik Dr. Eri Lfsquarc\\n[ report_end

male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .\\nOn the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.\\nHe was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .\\nHe was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .\\nHe was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .\\nHE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .\\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .\\nIt was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .\\nThe initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .\\nHe was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .\\nBecause of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNotable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone\\nALLERGIES :\\nPenicillin , which gives him a rash .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHis

mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .\\nHe had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .\\nThe left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .\\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .\\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .\\nOn hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .\\nThe patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .\\nThe Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .\\nOn the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .\\nThe intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .\\nAfter removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .\\nOn the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .\\nHowever , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .\\nThe peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .\\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .\\nOnce on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .\\nAn echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .\\nOn transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .\\nHe was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .\\nThe patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .\\nHe exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .\\nHe did not have chest pain .\\nThere were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .\\nThe thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .\\nBased on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .\\nThese findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .\\nBecause of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .\\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1.

prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .\\nDuring this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .\\nBone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .\\nThere was microvascular disease .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .\\nSpleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .\\nThere was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .\\nThe first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .\\nThis was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .\\nThe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\\nThus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\\nActually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\\nOn that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\\nBy 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\\nThe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\\nHe is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .\\nHe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .\\nEventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\\nTwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\\nIt was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\\nA central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\\nAfter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\\nThis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\\nCytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\\nThe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,\\n3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,\\n4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,\\n5. hypertension .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .\\nThe patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .\\nThe patient is on diet as tolerated .\\nThere will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .\\nGUABENFRANDA D.

Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .\\nThe biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .\\nMr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .\\nBone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .\\nIn December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .\\nSince that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .\\nCompression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .\\nMr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .\\nHe also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .\\nHe also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .\\nOn 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .\\nThey recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .\\nHe was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .\\nHe received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .\\nOn the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .\\nThe patient 's family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .\\nHe denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis adenocarcinoma is outlined above .\\n2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .\\n3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .\\nHis initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .\\nHis hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .\\nHis differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .\\nHis electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .\\nHis glucose was 166 .\\nHis calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .\\nHis chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :\\nThere was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .\\nThere was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .\\nThe right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .\\nHead computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .\\nThere may be two additional smaller metastases present .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThis is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .\\nHis temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .\\nHis oropharynx was benign .\\nHis neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .\\nHis lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .\\nOn cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .\\nHis abdomen :\\nHe did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .\\nExtremities :\\nHe had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nHis skin :\\nHe did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .\\nNeurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .\\nStrength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .\\nHis sensory examination was grossly intact .\\nThere were no cerebellar deficits .\\nHis reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .\\nThe patient 's HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :\\n1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .\\n2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .\\n3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .\\nThis may or may not be pathologic .\\nThe patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .\\nThe patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .\\nThe patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .\\nAlso of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .\\nThe patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .\\nThe patient 's sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .\\nThis hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient 's quality of life .\\nThe patient and the family opted for palliative X-ray therapy and home hospice .\\nThe patient was discharged with full knowledge of his grave prognosis , to go home with home hospice .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nDecadron , 2 mg. , po , q6h , to be tapered , Tylenol with Codeine , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Dilantin , 100 mg. , one tablet , po , t.i.d. , Colace , 100 mg. , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Nadolol , 40 mg. , one tablet , po , qD , Carafate , 1 tablet , po , q.i.d. , Dilaudid , 2 mg. , one tablet , po , q3-4h , Dulcolax , 1 tablet , po , qD , MS-Contin , 45 mg. , one tablet , po , qAM , and MS-Contin , 60 mg. , po , qPM , and Amoxicillin , 500 mg. , q.i.d.\\nThe patient is to follow up with his primary M.D. , Dr. Besti Kotebreun , and with the Radiation Oncologist , Dr. Skizeis for further X-ray therapy .\\nELLOT DAYS , M.D.\\nTR :\\njmr / bmot\\nDD :\\n4/16/94\\nTD :\\n04/17/94\\nCC :\\nSTAT discharge summary .\\nCopy to Dr. Ellot Days .\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .\\nHe developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nHe denied any angina .\\nHe had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .\\nHis pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .\\nAn echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .\\nHe was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .\\nA Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .\\nHis coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .\\nHe also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .\\nOn June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .\\nHe was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .\\nHis ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .\\nHe did smoke up to three pack per day .\\nHe has three children .\\nHe is retired .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nSix foot , 250 pounds .\\nHe is a well appearing male , in no distress .\\nHIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .\\nHis neck veins were not distended .\\nHis carotids showed bilateral bruits .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis abdomen is obese , but benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHe has no peripheral edema .\\nHis Neurological exam is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nsodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .\\nUric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .\\nhematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .\\nurinalysis was unremarkable .\\nHis chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .\\nThere were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .\\nThere , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .\\nThere was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\\nMAY A , M.D.\\nTR :\\not /

history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post

atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and

x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 )

the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" Mattox \" maneuvers were performed .\\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer \\'s lactate .\\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\\nThe patient \\'s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient \\'s course .\\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nN / A.\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nN / A.\\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\\nN / A.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMason Street .\\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\\nTR :\\nun / bmot\\nDD :\\n08-07-93\\nTD :\\n08/08/93\\nCC :\\n[ report_end ]\\n')],\n",

excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n2/14/94 - tracheostomy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .\\nHer work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .\\nHer x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .\\nShe underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .\\nShe was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n( 1 ) hysterectomy .\\n( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .\\n( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nprednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nrespirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :\\nsclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .\\nThe heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .\\nChest :\\ndecreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .\\nThe abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .\\nExtremities :\\nslight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .\\nADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :\\nRoom air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .\\nElectrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :\\ntiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nEarly in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .\\nHer oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\\nUpon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\\nThere were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\\nShe was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\\nShe underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\\nThese were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .\\nIntraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .\\nIt was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\\nThis proceeded uneventfully .\\nShe was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\\nHowever , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\\nThis appeared to be respiratory in origin .\\nShe was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\\nPressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .\\nHer blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\\nX-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\\nShe was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nEarly in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .\\nHer wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nShe developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\\nThis improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\\nShe remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\\nUltimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\\nHowever , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\\nThis improved her cardiac function .\\nShe failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\\nShe had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nThe right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nShe had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .\\nShe was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .\\nGiven her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .\\nThis was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .\\nHer support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.\\nThe patient 's family was notified

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\\nHis CVP was 16 .\\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\\nHe also remained intubated .\\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\\nThe balloon pump was restored .\\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\\nSupportive care continued .\\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\\nCAGHALA R.

AV conduction tissue disease .\\n2. Coronary artery disease .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRadiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nPatient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .\\nHe was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .\\nHe was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .\\nHe also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .\\nAt the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .\\nIn the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nEcotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .\\nJVP was not raised .\\nHis cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .\\nHis abdominal examination was benign .\\nLungs were clear .\\nHis EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .\\nHis EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .\\nIMPRESSION :\\nPatient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .\\nHe was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .\\nIt was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .\\nHis baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.\\nHe had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .\\nTwo radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .\\nThe patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .\\nThe procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .\\nOn the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .\\nThis was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .\\nHis atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .\\nThe atrial measurements were as follows :\\namplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .\\nHis ventricular measurements were as follows :\\nRV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .\\nThe patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .\\nNoninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .\\nA chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .\\nOf note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .\\nAfter discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .\\nThe patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .\\nHe has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nHis medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .\\nHe is being discharged on :\\n1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\n5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.\\n6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.\\n7.

Neurological :\\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\\n2. Pulmonary :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\\n3. Cardiovascular :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\\n4. Renal :\\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\\n5. Gastrointestinal :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\\n6. Infectious disease :\\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\\nShe ruled out by PPD .\\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable with issues resolving .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

PO q.d.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nBreunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .\\nShe is referred for progressive angina .\\nShe had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .\\nShe has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .\\nIn 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .\\nIn October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .\\nShe had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .\\nIn 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .\\nShe had exertional angina at that time .\\nIn November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .\\nShe had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .\\nSince that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .\\nShe was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .\\nBecause these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .\\nIn May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .\\nShe had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .\\nShe has had no syncope .\\nHer cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .\\nShe has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .\\nShe is a remote cigarette smoker .\\nShe also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .\\nShe has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci\\nShe lives alone .\\nHer son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .\\nThey live in Ohio .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .\\nHer blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .\\nNeck veins are not distended .\\nRespiratory rate 12 .\\nCarotids :\\nno bruits .\\nLungs were clear .\\nCardiac :\\n1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nPeripheral pulses intact .\\nNeurological examination non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .\\nHematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .\\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .\\nThere , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .\\nHer left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .\\nShe had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .\\nHer native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .\\nThe saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .\\nThe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\\nIn addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\\nHer left internal mammary artery was also unused .\\nIt was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\\nThis was intermittent .\\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\\nOn August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\\nThere was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .\\nIt just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .\\nShe tolerated this well .\\nHer medications were resumed .\\nShe ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .\\nACHASTHA N.

COURSE :\\n1 ) Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .\\nShe remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .\\nThe patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .\\nThe patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .\\nThe patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .\\nThe patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .\\nAt this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .\\n2 ) Neurological / vascular :\\nThe discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .\\nThe patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .\\nThe left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .\\nThe patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .\\nMRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .\\nThe patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .\\nThe patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .\\nThe results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .\\nA Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .\\n3 ) Orthopedic :\\nThe patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .\\nOutside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .\\nRepeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic

Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .\\nOn transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is divorced and retired .\\nShe lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is intubated .\\nVITAL SIGNS :\\nTemperature 98.6 , 66 .\\nRight arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .\\nTidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .\\nGENERAL :\\nShe was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .\\nNECK :\\nEdematous .\\nTrachea was midline .\\nShe had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .\\nThe superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .\\nShe had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .\\nHer anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .\\nLUNGS :\\nShe had bilateral expiratory wheezes .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with good bowel sounds .\\nIt was nontender .\\nIt was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .\\nBoth were easily reducible .\\nPULSE :\\nOn the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nCBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\\nCoags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .\\nHer gas was 7.47/40/332 .\\nElectrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\\nCT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\\nIt was consistent with a hematoma .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMs. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\\nThis showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\\nShe was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\\nThe differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\\nOn 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\\nA biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\\nThe operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\\nThere was no active bleeding at the time .\\nOver the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\\nShe had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\\nThe ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\\nGiven these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\\nThe Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\\nAt this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\\nDr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\\nShe underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\\nHer postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\\nThis required a chest tube .\\nHer hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\\nIt was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\\nHowever , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\\nShe underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\\nIt turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\\nIn conclusion , by systems :\\n1. Neuro .\\nThe patient became intermittently agitated .\\nWe have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\\nShe responds well to this .\\nShe speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\\nShe has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\\nShe has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\\n2. Cardiac .\\nThe patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\\nThis is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\\n3. Respiratory .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\\nHer right lung field is clear .\\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\\n4. GI .\\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\\nThis is her goal .\\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\\nThese have all been negative .\\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\\n5. GU .\\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\\n6. Heme .\\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\\nShe had no problems with this .\\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\\n7. ID .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\\n8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\\nThe patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\\nHer central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAlbuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .\\nCONDITION :\\nStable , with active problems being respiratory failure , urinary tract infection , and bleeding diathesis .\\nDISCHARGE LABS :\\nOn the day of discharge , sodium 145 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 109 , bicarb 31 , creatinine 0.7 , BUN 43 , glucose 116 .\\nCBC 14.9 , 29.2 ( which is stable ) , and 398 .\\nPT 12 , PTT 27 , and INR 1.0 .\\nMagnesium of 1.9 .\\nCalcium 8.1 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nNone .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to an acute rehab facility .\\nShe should follow-up with Dr. Ryna Jescdrig as well as Dr. Lenni Lung in the Vascular Surgery Department in approximately three to four weeks .\\nPlease call the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Verg Medical Center for any further details that may be needed .\\nYou can also page Sta Lung , M.D. as I am the dictating physician who has been taking care of Ms. Shuffa for quite some time now .\\nI would be happy to answer any questions .\\nMy pager number at Verg Medical Center is number 12360 .\\nDictated By :\\nSTA LUNG , M.D. HU53\\nAttending :\\nRYNA R.

underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\\nIn the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\\nIn early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\\nIn 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\\nIn early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\\nCT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\\nIn April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\\nThereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\\nMost recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\\nThat hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\\nHe was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\\nIt was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\\nFinally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .\\nMr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .\\nAs well he has complained of some

Medical Center .\\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .\\n2. Hypertension .\\n3. Status post hernia repair .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .\\n5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .\\nHead , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :\\nnegative .\\nNeck was supple .\\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\\n2+ carotids without bruits .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .\\nExtremities :\\nthe patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .\\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\\nSodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .\\nThe patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\\nThe graft used was a homograft .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nDiet :\\nHigh calorie , high protein .\\nThe patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .\\nThe patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nThe patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .\\nThe patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .\\nThe patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.\\n2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .\\n5. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n6. Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .\\n9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .\\nFOLLOWUP :\\nThe patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .\\nThe patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .\\nThe patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .\\nThe patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .\\nDr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .\\nRYNA DAU , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nNISTE MA RHALT , M.D.\\nTR :\\noq\\nDD :\\n09/13/1998\\nTD :\\n09/13/1998 7:18 A\\ncc :\\nKEND N BOTH , M.D. CARDIAC FELLOWS ROOM LOLI MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER NACO MESPRHALT , M.D. INFECTIOUS DISEASE UNIT CIL HOSPITAL RYNA R DAU , M.D. SURGICAL RESIDENT SURG AG NISTE MA RHALT , M.D. SURGERY BROTROJEUNECOCK HEALTH CHPO E ENLA GENERAL , M.D. SURGERY ON HOSPITAL STAT EDITED 09/15/1998 RT\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

:\\n08/01/1998\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :\\n1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .\\n2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .\\n3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nOn May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .\\nShe was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .\\nOn May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .\\nHer oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .\\nChest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .\\nA VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .\\nOn May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .\\nAt this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nShe was started on a steroid trial at that point .\\nHer pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .\\nOn June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .\\nThe patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .\\nFrom May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .\\nOn June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .\\n2 ) Hypertension .\\n3 ) Status post hysterectomy .\\n4 ) Status post appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\n1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n2 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .\\n4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.\\n5 ) Thiamine .\\n6 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n8 ) Folic acid .\\n9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .\\n10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .\\n11 ) Insulin sliding scale .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient had no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is divorced .\\nShe has two children .\\nShe recently retired as a clerical worker .\\nShe denies any tobacco .\\nShe has only social alcohol use .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nFather died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .\\nMother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .\\nBrother has coronary artery disease .\\nThere is no family history of hematologic problems .\\nLABORATORY :\\nLaboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :\\nThe video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nThe patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .\\nThis was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\\nBy discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\\nThe patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\\nRepeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\\nAt the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\\n2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\\nThe patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .\\nShe was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .\\nHer platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .\\nHer LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .\\nShe continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .\\nThe patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .\\nEventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .\\nAfter this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .\\nIt is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .\\nShe will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .\\n3 ) Renal :\\nThe patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .\\nThroughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\\nThe opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\\nShe required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\\nDuring the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .\\n4 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .\\nThe patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .\\nShe received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .\\nIn addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .\\nShe also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .\\nShe was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .\\nThe patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .\\n5 ) Rheumatology :\\nThe patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nUnfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .\\nA repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\n1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .\\n2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .\\nThe nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .\\n3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .\\n4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .\\nThe left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .\\nShe would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .\\n5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .\\n6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .\\n7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .\\n8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455

one tablet daily and Albuterol nebulizers qid .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease .\\nShe does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .\\nShe has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .\\nShe denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .\\nOn the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .\\nHer sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .\\nThe electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .\\nRight sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .\\nShe was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed .\\nThe blood sugar was elevated at 208 .\\nThe BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .\\nThe uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .\\nWhen she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .\\nIn the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .\\nThe electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .\\nShe had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .\\nHer only medication was Dyazide .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .\\nThe pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .\\nThe respirations 18 and she was afebrile .\\nThe jugular veins were not distended .\\nThe carotids were full .\\nThere were no bruits .\\nThe chest was clear with distant breath sounds .\\nThe cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .\\nThere were no rubs .\\nThe abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .\\nThere was no peripheral edema .\\nThere were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .\\nThere was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .\\nHer electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .\\nThe cholesterol was 171 .\\nTriglycerides 103 .\\nBy this time her CK was 600 .\\nHer hematocrit was 37.1 .\\nHemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .\\nThe PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .\\nReview of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .\\nShe was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .\\nShe was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe became increasingly disoriented .\\nShe developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\\nThe chest films showed mild cephalization .\\nShe became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .\\nShe went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .\\nShe had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .\\nCatheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .\\nThe right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .\\nShe had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\\nShe continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\\nDobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\\nShe was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .\\nShe was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .\\nEventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .\\nShe had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .\\nShe was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .\\nThe BUN rose to 91 .\\nHer Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .\\nShe was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .\\nEfforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .\\nThe right ventricular function was normal .\\nAfter extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\\nThere was no structural abnormality .\\nMoistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\\nShe continued a rather slow improvement .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .\\nThe possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .\\nShe had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nRenal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\\nShe had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\\nThat can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nBecause of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\\nThis was followed up and was shown to resolve .\\nMR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\\nA MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\\nShe was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nSHASQUALENA R.

:\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n2/15/94\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n2/28/94\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .\\nApparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .\\nHe came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .\\nHe had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .\\nHe became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .\\nOther medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .\\nHe also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .\\nHe had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .\\nThere were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .\\nHe had no cardiac murmur .\\nHis abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .\\nThe neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nIncluded a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .\\nThere were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .\\nThe platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .\\nHis prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .\\nHis uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .\\nThere was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .\\nAn electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .\\nHe did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .\\nHe also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .\\nHis headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .\\nThere was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .\\nTransfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .\\nAmicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .\\nA bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .\\nHe was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .\\nThe renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .\\nThe family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .\\nHe was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .\\nThey agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .\\nNo autopsy was obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nlj / bmot\\nDD :\\n3/12/94\\nTD :\\n03/13/94\\nCC :\\nDr. Ca Shuff , FIH Oregon Dr. Ille Kote\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",
