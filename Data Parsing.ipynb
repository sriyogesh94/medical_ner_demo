History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nNone\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThis is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\\nThere were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\\nShe had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\\nThe patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\\nThe weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\\nHer appetite was gone .\\nShe was having some nausea .\\nNo recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\\nNo changes in her breathing .\\nShe did not seem sleepy or confused .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\\nWeight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\\nTemperature 97 .\\nThe patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\\nShe could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\\nShe has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nheart ; without murmur or gallop .\\nHer jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\\nsoft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nShe had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\\nShe was moving all four extremities .\\nHer cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nHematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\\nOver the following days , she was gently hydrated .\\nHer urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\\nShe was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\\nIn the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\\nShe tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\\nThe patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\\nThe family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\\nThey did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\\nBy the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\\nOn the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\\nThere had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\\nPotassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\\nShe was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\\nThe problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\\nThe patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\\nThe patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\\nShe will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\\n2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\\nshe also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\\n5.

.\\nMr. Kulrinne has a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity .\\nHe had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall .\\nHe was placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .\\nOn medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .\\nAn attempt at medical management was continued .\\nHowever , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission

.\\nNo significant murmurs .\\nAbdomen :\\nObese and soft .\\nExtremities :\\nWithout edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .\\nHe became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHowever , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nIn the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\\nHe was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\\nHe was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\\nThe circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\\nThe right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\\nA balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\\nThe patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\\nThe procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\\nThe distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\\nA good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\\nHis peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\\nThe patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\\nHe underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\\nIn addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\\nIt was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\\nIn addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\\nHead CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\\nIn addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\\nThe patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\\nThis was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\\nHe tolerated it well .\\nThe ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\\nThe patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHe had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\\nHe was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\\nHe is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\\nAt the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\\nHe has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\\nOf note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\\nElectronically Signed RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D. 02/17/2002 11:29\\n_____________________________ RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nfb\\nDD :\\n02/06/2002\\nTD

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

:\\n4-13-93\\nDIAGNOSES :\\nAortic stenosis .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nStenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\n4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .\\n4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .\\nThis involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .\\nHe did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .\\nHe underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .\\nFollowing this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .\\nOver the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .\\nHe also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .\\nThe patient was referred here for further evaluation .\\nMr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .\\nThe blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .\\nThere were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .\\nThere was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .\\nThe cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .\\nThere was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .\\nThe liver was not palpable .\\nThere were diminished pulses in the legs .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .\\nThe electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .\\nThe chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nI indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\\nAccordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\\nThe study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\\nThe right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\\nUsing transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\\nThe left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\\nAn attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\\nOn April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\\nAt the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\\nThere was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\\nI have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\\nThe valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\\nThe surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\\nMr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .\\nHe had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .\\nHe seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .\\nThere was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .\\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .\\nThe patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .\\nThe heart appeared to be flaccid .\\nWe really have no good explanation of what this was all about .\\nHe was being treated for a possible pneumonia .\\nHe did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .\\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .\\nThe patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .\\nA post mortem examination will be performed .\\nTAARNNA LANCELOILNEG , M.D.\\nTR :\\nra /

( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nRemarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .\\nHis pulse exam was intact .\\nCardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .\\nThere was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .\\nA patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .\\nAlso of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .\\nPost-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .\\nHe remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .\\nTransthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .\\nThe next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .\\nThe patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nIn the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .\\nOn December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .\\nThe total bypass time :\\n2 hours 25 minutes .\\nTotal crossclamp time :\\n1 hour and 48 minutes .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .\\nThe patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .\\nChest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .\\nAggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .\\nIn addition , he remained agitated .\\nThis was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .\\nOn day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .\\nHis urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .\\nDespite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .\\nHe required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .\\nHe received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .\\nVery early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .\\nWith positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .\\nThroughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .\\nException was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .\\nHis chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .\\nInfectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nCardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\\nConsequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\\nIn addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\\nOn the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\\nOn 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\\nIt was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\\nAt approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\\nThe patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\\nWithin one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\\nThe patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\\nThe patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\\nThe chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\\nCompressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\\nThe patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .\\nFurther attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\\nThe family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbp / bmot\\nDD :\\n12/17/93\\nTD :\\n12/18/93\\nCC :\\nG Hemp , M.D. Taarnna Has , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

Medical Center because of alleged intractible ascites .\\nThe patient had a history of post tranfusion hepatitis to twenty years duration , allegedly due to hepatitis C , and had previously failed therapy with Prednisone , and also Interferon .\\nShe had been known to have chronic liver disease , X 12 years .\\nIn the fall she began to have episodes of seizures associated with asystole , and for this reason had recently had a pacemaker implanted .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Iming Medical Center in February and March of 1992 , on Mar 20 , 1992 , a permanent BVI pacemaker was

without sign of obstruction on 4/17/92 .\\nGaited blood pool scan on 4/18/92 shows slight decrease left ventricular function with an LVEF of 45% , minimal wall motion abnormalities confined to a small zone of the apex .\\nPersantine Thallium study , no definite evidence of ischemia or infarction .\\nAbdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography showed cirrhotic liver with markedly enlarged portal vein and recannulization of the umbilical vein prominent acidic fluid in the abdomen , moderate splenomegaly , right renal cyst , status post hysterectomy .\\nelectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia , first degree AV block , left axis deviation .\\nAt the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for two days and then switched to Unasyn 3 grams per day .\\nThe patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy .\\nThe patient was evaluated for long term therapy .\\nThe patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with Aldactone and Lasix .\\nMarked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several days .\\nBecause of the patient 's history of asystole , she was discussed with Dr. White as a possible transplant candidate .\\nHe felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out .\\nFor that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45% ejection fraction .\\nA Persantine Thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia .\\nHer diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting .\\nThe patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by Dr. White , who felt , although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function .\\nAn upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4/23/92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus .\\nMeanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells , with no preponderance of polys .\\nThe patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds .\\nAt the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued , and an optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to be between 126 and 128 .\\nThis period of time there was a brief increase in her SGOT from the 100 's to 230 .\\nShe was discharged home on 5/5/92 on the following program .\\n1600 calorie ADA diet .\\nNo free water , no added salt , 60 gram protein diet .\\nTegretol 200 mg. d

or S4 , a grade II / VI systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a flow murmur .\\nNo peripheral edema was noted .\\nThe jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place .\\nThe carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally .\\nThe vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants .\\nIt was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness .\\nHe had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and no masses were felt .\\nThe genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender .\\nThere was no urethritis , no balinitis , normal prostate , nontender .\\nThere was tan guaiac positive stool with no masses .\\nThe musculoskeletal exam showed well developed ,

.\\nThe sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam .\\nReflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .\\nThe SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .\\nLactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .\\nHematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .\\nThe MCV is 88 .\\nThe prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .\\nThe urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .\\nThe CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .\\nThe urine sodium was 147 .\\nThe serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .\\nAn I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .\\nThe abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .\\nChest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .\\nHe was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .\\n1-Rhabdomyolysis .\\nThe patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .\\nThis resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .\\nThe patient \\'s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .\\nThe aldolase was positive at 142 .\\nThis was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .\\nThe patient \\'s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .\\nThe patient \\'s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .\\nNevertheless , the patient \\'s renal failure continued to progress .\\nOver the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .\\nMuch of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .\\n2-Renal failure .\\nThe creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .\\nThe urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .\\nPeritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .\\nSubsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .\\nHe continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .\\n3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .\\nOn admission the patient \\'s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .\\nHe went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .\\nThe patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .\\nHis DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .\\n4-Septic shock .\\nThe patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\\nThis will be discussed below .\\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\\n5-Hepatic failure .\\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .\\nGiven his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .\\n6-Cocaine intoxication .\\nSerum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .\\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .\\n7-Pneumonia .\\nThe patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .\\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .\\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\\n8-Pancreatitis .\\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\\n9-Catheter tip infections .\\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\\n10-Anemia .\\nThe patient \\'s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\\n11-Coma .\\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient \\'s persistent coagulopathy .\\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nCocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .\\nCOMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :\\nNeck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nNone .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient was discharged to Samfer Street with no autopsy .\\nLENNI HEAD , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbe

History of M. kansasaii with workup by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital proceeding currently .\\n# 3. History of breast cancer .\\nIn December 1990 she had a lumpectomy , from left breast , and XRT x 35 .\\nNo axillary dissection was done because she was status post MI .\\nShe received Tamoxifen briefly .\\nMammogram was normal 7/92 , and 5/92 .\\nShe is allergic to Amoxicillin , having developed a rash , does not smoke , does not drink .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nDyazide one p.o. q.d.

Glaucoma drops .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 118/75 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 , in no acute distress .\\nHead and neck exam was unremarkable , except for the right eye being patched over .\\nLungs were clear .\\nBreasts were unremarkable .\\nBack was nontender .\\nHeart exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm , jugular venous pressure was normal , no carotid bruit was noted ; murmur , rub , gallop , click and ectopy were absent .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nRectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithout clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis .\\nNormal pulses were palpated .\\nNeurologic exam :\\nthe patient was alert and oriented x 4 .\\nExtensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes .\\nThere was a touch an anosognosia .\\nCranial nerve exam :\\nvisual fields were full o.s. , visual acuity was 20/70 o.s.\\nPupil o.s. reacted to light .\\nEOMs with full range of movement , no nystagmus .\\nVIIth cranial nerve :\\ninferior left weak .\\nNo gag was present .\\nOtherwise normal CN 's .\\nDTRs showed a mild decrease in left biceps and brachioradialis reflexes , otherwise normal tone , symmetrical reflexes , downgoing toes .\\nMotor exam :\\n5+ throughout , except left hand intrinsic muscles were 4+ , 3+ in the middle digits .\\nNo atrophy was noted .\\nSensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception .\\nCerebellar exam :\\nfinger / to/nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel-to-shin was good with few errors .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nChest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities .\\nEKG :\\nleft bundle branch block .\\nUrinalysis was unremarkable .\\nBUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .\\nHer admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .\\nAlbumin 2.5 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\\nThis was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\\nThe possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\\nHer echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\\nPrevious echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .\\nHer Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .\\nThe patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .\\nShe was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .\\nHer exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .\\nHer pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .\\nShe needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .\\nIn addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .\\nIt is discontinued at the time of transport .\\nThe patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\\nDuring evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\\nOn our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\\nThere are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\\nAt the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\\nWhat follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\\nHer ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\\nMoreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\\nOur leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\\nAs I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\\nWhile mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\\nTwo possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\\nThese tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\\nThe patient has glaucoma .\\nHer medications are as listed below .\\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nPropanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d.

dilated cardiomyopathy with history of intra-atrial thrombus .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nUndergone during this hospital admission was a left brachial artery embolectomy .\\nThe patient also underwent upper endoscopy and a left wrist fine needle aspiration .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 76 year old white male with a probable brachial artery embolism .\\nThe patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was previously on Coumadin because of a prior embolic cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient had his Coumadin discontinued in January 1992 secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nThe patient was swimming at 4:00 o 'clock this afternoon when he experienced left upper extremity pain and paralysis .\\nHe was evaluated at Sephsandpot Center and referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for evaluation .\\nThe patient is righthanded .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. cardiomyopathy .\\n2. atrial fibrillation .\\n3.

EXAMINATION :\\n( at time of admission ) the systolic blood pressure is 180 , his head and neck examination within normal limits .\\nCardiac :\\nhe has a II out of VI systolic ejection murmur which is loudest at the right upper sternal border .\\nHis chest is clear .\\nHis abdomen was benign .\\nHis rectal examination guaiac negative .\\nOf greatest note on his pulse examination :\\nhis carotid , femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2 plus both right and left .\\nHis subclavian artery and axillary artery pulses are 2 plus bilaterally .\\nHis brachial pulse is 2 plus , radial pulse 2 plus and ulnar pulse 2 plus on the right .\\nOn the left he has no brachial , no radial and no ulnar pulse .\\nHis left hand and arm strength is 4/4 with decreased sensation in the left fingers in the median and ulnar distribution .\\nThe impression :\\na probable brachial artery embolus .\\nThe plan is to perform an urgent embolectomy .\\nThe risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent has been obtained .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room .\\nThe preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .\\nThe postoperative diagnosis , the same .\\nThe procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .\\nThe surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .\\nThe findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .\\nThere were no complications .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .\\nOn postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .\\nHe was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .\\nIn addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .\\nThe patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\\nHis assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nHe recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\\nThese recommendations were already underway .\\nConsequently we simply continued our management .\\nThe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\\nOn 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\\nDr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nDuring this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\\nHe had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\\nFollow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\\nThere was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .\\nThe stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .\\nFrom Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .\\nWe discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\\nIt was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\\nThat was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\\nGiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\\nThe findings were as follows .\\nThe principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\\nThe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .\\nIn the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\\nThere were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\\nThe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\\nNo biopsy was taken .\\nThe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\\nOn 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\\nFindings were :\\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\\nThere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\\nThe aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\\nThere was trace aortic insufficiency .\\nThe aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\\nThe left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a

insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\\nThere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\\nThe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\\nHe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\\nOn 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\\nHe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\\nThe Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\\nJoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\\nJoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\\nThe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\\nA wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\\nThe patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\\nHe is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\\nToday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\\nYesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\\nToday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\\nConsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\\nThe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nIsordil 10 mg.

Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .\\nAt that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .\\nThe admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .\\nThe patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .\\nOne month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .\\nThereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .\\nThis course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .\\nAn abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nBilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .\\nTwo days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .\\nOn this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .\\nShe was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs as detailed above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nShe is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .\\nALLERGIES :\\nShe is allergic to shellfish .\\nDRUG ALLERGIES :\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nInclude Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\n( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .\\nShe was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .\\nHead and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .\\nShe had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .\\nAbdomen :\\nshowed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nPelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .\\nThe patient was occult blood negative .\\nExtremities :\\nshowed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .\\nHowever , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\n( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .\\nI and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\\nChest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nThe patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\\nShe also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\\nIt was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\\nLaboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\\nUrinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\\nIn view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\\nRepeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\\nRenal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\\nDr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\\nHe requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\\nNeither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\\nIn view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\\nAs a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\\nShe was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\\nSputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\\nOn the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\\nHer urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\\nHowever , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\\nOn 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\\nHer Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\\nOn June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\\nShe was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\\nIn view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\\nOn 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\\nUrinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\\nA Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\\nAn electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\\nNo computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\\nShe continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\\nOff her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\\nFor this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\\nThe mucosa appeared to be preserved .\\nIn addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\\nThe patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\\nThe patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\\nHer sensorium had cleared .\\nBecause of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .\\nThe patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\\nIn addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\\nDespite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\\nA Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\\nOn conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\\nAnd she was not given platelets in addition .\\nThroughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .\\nAfter much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .\\nOn August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .\\nOn June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .\\nThe PEG tube was found to be draining well .\\nShe was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .\\nThe patient 's prognosis is guarded .\\nHer current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nInclude omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.\\nShe will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nThe patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .\\nLONGKEND SAPSHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nSLAINEAEE S.

alcohol ingestion .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .\\nChest was clear .\\nHeart had regular rate and rhythm .\\nNeck was supple without mass or bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nCalves were nontender .\\nOn neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .\\nShe looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .\\nHer face was strong and symmetric .\\nShe felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .\\nHer extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .\\nShe sees light only od. which is chronic .\\nShe reads large print os.\\nHer tongue was midline and her palate

plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .\\nA head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .\\nMRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .\\nThis revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .\\nThis was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nThe internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .\\nAfter much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .\\nThe patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .\\nThis showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .\\nOne coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nIt was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .\\nAlso the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .\\nTherefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .\\nTherefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .\\nAt this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .\\nTherefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .\\nThe patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .\\nHer pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .\\nHer consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nPROCEDURES :\\nOn 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .\\n01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\n01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nThere were no noted complications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\ninclude heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. ,

Chest CT scan .\\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\\nNone .\\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\\nNone .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\\nOver the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\\nHe has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\\nAlthough in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\\nThe patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\\nHe has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\\nHe does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nOn examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nHis blood pressure was 110/70 .\\nHeart was 82 and regular .\\nRespiratory rate was 16 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\\nLungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\\nThe first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\\nThere was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nThere was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\\nThe extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\\nThe posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\\nAlbumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\\nThe chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\\nThe ECG was paced .\\nAn outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\\nThere was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\\nThe aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\\nThere was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\\nIn addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\\nWhile in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\\nThe patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\\nThe patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\\nIn addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\\nHe will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1.

.\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\nVQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .\\nIn the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .\\nUpon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\\nIn addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\\nThe patient lives on Quelene with his wife .\\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\\nMr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\\nThere was no thyromegaly .\\nCarotids were 2+ .\\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\\nThe urinalysis was negative .\\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nImdur 120 mg.

arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. Bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in December , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\\nIn addition , Mr. Bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\\nThe patient lives on Ewi with his wife .\\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\\nMr. Bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\\nThere was no thyromegaly .\\nCarotids were 2+ .\\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\\nThe urinalysis was negative .\\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. Fraction within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nImdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

OPERATIONS :\\n10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .\\nShe was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nAtenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d.

and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .\\nIt was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .\\nHowever , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .\\nThe patient tolerated the initial procedure well .\\nOn the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .\\nShe was awake and following commands .\\nIt was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .\\nThe patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past

pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .\\nSince that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .\\nHer current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .\\nHer prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .\\nThe patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .\\nWe feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nCoumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .\\nHer dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .\\nOther medications include :\\nIsordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .\\nThe patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .\\nAdditionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient is transferred to Villrow Health .\\nShe should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .\\nShe should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .\\nShe will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .\\nDALYWOO DROREITE , M.D.\\nTR :\\niq / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-4-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC

the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\\nFor a short time , she seemed \" locked in \" .\\nShe has

, the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient \\'s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient \\'s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nCoronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\\nHABITS :\\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\\nThere was no splenomegaly .\\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nyf / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-3-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Swatlleebtik Dr. Eri Lfsquarc\\n[ report_end

male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .\\nOn the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.\\nHe was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .\\nHe was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .\\nHe was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .\\nHE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .\\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .\\nIt was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .\\nThe initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .\\nHe was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .\\nBecause of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNotable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone\\nALLERGIES :\\nPenicillin , which gives him a rash .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHis

mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .\\nHe had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .\\nThe left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .\\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .\\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .\\nOn hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .\\nThe patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .\\nThe Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .\\nOn the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .\\nThe intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .\\nAfter removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .\\nOn the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .\\nHowever , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .\\nThe peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .\\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .\\nOnce on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .\\nAn echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .\\nOn transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .\\nHe was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .\\nThe patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .\\nHe exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .\\nHe did not have chest pain .\\nThere were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .\\nThe thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .\\nBased on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .\\nThese findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .\\nBecause of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .\\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1.

prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .\\nDuring this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .\\nBone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .\\nThere was microvascular disease .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .\\nSpleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .\\nThere was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .\\nThe first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .\\nThis was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .\\nThe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\\nThus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\\nActually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\\nOn that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\\nBy 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\\nThe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\\nHe is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .\\nHe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .\\nEventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\\nTwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\\nIt was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\\nA central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\\nAfter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\\nThis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\\nCytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\\nThe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,\\n3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,\\n4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,\\n5. hypertension .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .\\nThe patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .\\nThe patient is on diet as tolerated .\\nThere will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .\\nGUABENFRANDA D.

Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .\\nThe biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .\\nMr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .\\nBone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .\\nIn December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .\\nSince that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .\\nCompression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .\\nMr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .\\nHe also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .\\nHe also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .\\nOn 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .\\nThey recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .\\nHe was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .\\nHe received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .\\nOn the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .\\nThe patient 's family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .\\nHe denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis adenocarcinoma is outlined above .\\n2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .\\n3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .\\nHis initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .\\nHis hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .\\nHis differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .\\nHis electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .\\nHis glucose was 166 .\\nHis calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .\\nHis chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :\\nThere was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .\\nThere was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .\\nThe right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .\\nHead computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .\\nThere may be two additional smaller metastases present .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThis is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .\\nHis temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .\\nHis oropharynx was benign .\\nHis neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .\\nHis lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .\\nOn cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .\\nHis abdomen :\\nHe did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .\\nExtremities :\\nHe had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nHis skin :\\nHe did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .\\nNeurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .\\nStrength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .\\nHis sensory examination was grossly intact .\\nThere were no cerebellar deficits .\\nHis reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .\\nThe patient 's HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :\\n1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .\\n2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .\\n3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .\\nThis may or may not be pathologic .\\nThe patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .\\nThe patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .\\nThe patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .\\nAlso of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .\\nThe patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .\\nThe patient 's sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .\\nThis hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient 's quality of life .\\nThe patient and the family opted for palliative X-ray therapy and home hospice .\\nThe patient was discharged with full knowledge of his grave prognosis , to go home with home hospice .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nDecadron , 2 mg. , po , q6h , to be tapered , Tylenol with Codeine , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Dilantin , 100 mg. , one tablet , po , t.i.d. , Colace , 100 mg. , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Nadolol , 40 mg. , one tablet , po , qD , Carafate , 1 tablet , po , q.i.d. , Dilaudid , 2 mg. , one tablet , po , q3-4h , Dulcolax , 1 tablet , po , qD , MS-Contin , 45 mg. , one tablet , po , qAM , and MS-Contin , 60 mg. , po , qPM , and Amoxicillin , 500 mg. , q.i.d.\\nThe patient is to follow up with his primary M.D. , Dr. Besti Kotebreun , and with the Radiation Oncologist , Dr. Skizeis for further X-ray therapy .\\nELLOT DAYS , M.D.\\nTR :\\njmr / bmot\\nDD :\\n4/16/94\\nTD :\\n04/17/94\\nCC :\\nSTAT discharge summary .\\nCopy to Dr. Ellot Days .\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .\\nHe developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nHe denied any angina .\\nHe had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .\\nHis pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .\\nAn echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .\\nHe was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .\\nA Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .\\nHis coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .\\nHe also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .\\nOn June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .\\nHe was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .\\nHis ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .\\nHe did smoke up to three pack per day .\\nHe has three children .\\nHe is retired .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nSix foot , 250 pounds .\\nHe is a well appearing male , in no distress .\\nHIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .\\nHis neck veins were not distended .\\nHis carotids showed bilateral bruits .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis abdomen is obese , but benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHe has no peripheral edema .\\nHis Neurological exam is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nsodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .\\nUric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .\\nhematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .\\nurinalysis was unremarkable .\\nHis chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .\\nThere were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .\\nThere , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .\\nThere was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\\nMAY A , M.D.\\nTR :\\not /

history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post

atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and

x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 )

the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" Mattox \" maneuvers were performed .\\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer \\'s lactate .\\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\\nThe patient \\'s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient \\'s course .\\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nN / A.\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nN / A.\\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\\nN / A.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMason Street .\\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\\nTR :\\nun / bmot\\nDD :\\n08-07-93\\nTD :\\n08/08/93\\nCC :\\n[ report_end ]\\n')],\n",

excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n2/14/94 - tracheostomy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .\\nHer work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .\\nHer x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .\\nShe underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .\\nShe was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n( 1 ) hysterectomy .\\n( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .\\n( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nprednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nrespirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :\\nsclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .\\nThe heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .\\nChest :\\ndecreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .\\nThe abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .\\nExtremities :\\nslight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .\\nADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :\\nRoom air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .\\nElectrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :\\ntiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nEarly in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .\\nHer oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\\nUpon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\\nThere were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\\nShe was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\\nShe underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\\nThese were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .\\nIntraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .\\nIt was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\\nThis proceeded uneventfully .\\nShe was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\\nHowever , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\\nThis appeared to be respiratory in origin .\\nShe was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\\nPressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .\\nHer blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\\nX-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\\nShe was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nEarly in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .\\nHer wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nShe developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\\nThis improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\\nShe remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\\nUltimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\\nHowever , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\\nThis improved her cardiac function .\\nShe failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\\nShe had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nThe right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nShe had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .\\nShe was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .\\nGiven her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .\\nThis was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .\\nHer support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.\\nThe patient 's family was notified

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\\nHis CVP was 16 .\\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\\nHe also remained intubated .\\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\\nThe balloon pump was restored .\\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\\nSupportive care continued .\\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\\nCAGHALA R.

AV conduction tissue disease .\\n2. Coronary artery disease .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRadiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nPatient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .\\nHe was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .\\nHe was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .\\nHe also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .\\nAt the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .\\nIn the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nEcotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .\\nJVP was not raised .\\nHis cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .\\nHis abdominal examination was benign .\\nLungs were clear .\\nHis EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .\\nHis EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .\\nIMPRESSION :\\nPatient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .\\nHe was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .\\nIt was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .\\nHis baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.\\nHe had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .\\nTwo radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .\\nThe patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .\\nThe procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .\\nOn the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .\\nThis was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .\\nHis atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .\\nThe atrial measurements were as follows :\\namplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .\\nHis ventricular measurements were as follows :\\nRV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .\\nThe patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .\\nNoninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .\\nA chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .\\nOf note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .\\nAfter discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .\\nThe patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .\\nHe has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nHis medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .\\nHe is being discharged on :\\n1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\n5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.\\n6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.\\n7.

Neurological :\\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\\n2. Pulmonary :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\\n3. Cardiovascular :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\\n4. Renal :\\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\\n5. Gastrointestinal :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\\n6. Infectious disease :\\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\\nShe ruled out by PPD .\\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable with issues resolving .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

PO q.d.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nBreunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .\\nShe is referred for progressive angina .\\nShe had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .\\nShe has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .\\nIn 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .\\nIn October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .\\nShe had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .\\nIn 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .\\nShe had exertional angina at that time .\\nIn November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .\\nShe had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .\\nSince that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .\\nShe was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .\\nBecause these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .\\nIn May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .\\nShe had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .\\nShe has had no syncope .\\nHer cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .\\nShe has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .\\nShe is a remote cigarette smoker .\\nShe also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .\\nShe has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci\\nShe lives alone .\\nHer son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .\\nThey live in Ohio .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .\\nHer blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .\\nNeck veins are not distended .\\nRespiratory rate 12 .\\nCarotids :\\nno bruits .\\nLungs were clear .\\nCardiac :\\n1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nPeripheral pulses intact .\\nNeurological examination non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .\\nHematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .\\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .\\nThere , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .\\nHer left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .\\nShe had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .\\nHer native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .\\nThe saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .\\nThe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\\nIn addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\\nHer left internal mammary artery was also unused .\\nIt was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\\nThis was intermittent .\\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\\nOn August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\\nThere was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .\\nIt just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .\\nShe tolerated this well .\\nHer medications were resumed .\\nShe ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .\\nACHASTHA N.

COURSE :\\n1 ) Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .\\nShe remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .\\nThe patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .\\nThe patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .\\nThe patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .\\nThe patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .\\nAt this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .\\n2 ) Neurological / vascular :\\nThe discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .\\nThe patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .\\nThe left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .\\nThe patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .\\nMRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .\\nThe patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .\\nThe patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .\\nThe results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .\\nA Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .\\n3 ) Orthopedic :\\nThe patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .\\nOutside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .\\nRepeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic

Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .\\nOn transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is divorced and retired .\\nShe lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is intubated .\\nVITAL SIGNS :\\nTemperature 98.6 , 66 .\\nRight arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .\\nTidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .\\nGENERAL :\\nShe was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .\\nNECK :\\nEdematous .\\nTrachea was midline .\\nShe had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .\\nThe superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .\\nShe had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .\\nHer anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .\\nLUNGS :\\nShe had bilateral expiratory wheezes .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with good bowel sounds .\\nIt was nontender .\\nIt was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .\\nBoth were easily reducible .\\nPULSE :\\nOn the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nCBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\\nCoags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .\\nHer gas was 7.47/40/332 .\\nElectrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\\nCT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\\nIt was consistent with a hematoma .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMs. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\\nThis showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\\nShe was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\\nThe differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\\nOn 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\\nA biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\\nThe operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\\nThere was no active bleeding at the time .\\nOver the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\\nShe had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\\nThe ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\\nGiven these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\\nThe Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\\nAt this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\\nDr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\\nShe underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\\nHer postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\\nThis required a chest tube .\\nHer hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\\nIt was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\\nHowever , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\\nShe underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\\nIt turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\\nIn conclusion , by systems :\\n1. Neuro .\\nThe patient became intermittently agitated .\\nWe have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\\nShe responds well to this .\\nShe speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\\nShe has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\\nShe has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\\n2. Cardiac .\\nThe patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\\nThis is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\\n3. Respiratory .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\\nHer right lung field is clear .\\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\\n4. GI .\\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\\nThis is her goal .\\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\\nThese have all been negative .\\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\\n5. GU .\\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\\n6. Heme .\\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\\nShe had no problems with this .\\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\\n7. ID .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\\n8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\\nThe patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\\nHer central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAlbuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .\\nCONDITION :\\nStable , with active problems being respiratory failure , urinary tract infection , and bleeding diathesis .\\nDISCHARGE LABS :\\nOn the day of discharge , sodium 145 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 109 , bicarb 31 , creatinine 0.7 , BUN 43 , glucose 116 .\\nCBC 14.9 , 29.2 ( which is stable ) , and 398 .\\nPT 12 , PTT 27 , and INR 1.0 .\\nMagnesium of 1.9 .\\nCalcium 8.1 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nNone .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to an acute rehab facility .\\nShe should follow-up with Dr. Ryna Jescdrig as well as Dr. Lenni Lung in the Vascular Surgery Department in approximately three to four weeks .\\nPlease call the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Verg Medical Center for any further details that may be needed .\\nYou can also page Sta Lung , M.D. as I am the dictating physician who has been taking care of Ms. Shuffa for quite some time now .\\nI would be happy to answer any questions .\\nMy pager number at Verg Medical Center is number 12360 .\\nDictated By :\\nSTA LUNG , M.D. HU53\\nAttending :\\nRYNA R.

underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\\nIn the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\\nIn early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\\nIn 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\\nIn early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\\nCT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\\nIn April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\\nThereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\\nMost recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\\nThat hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\\nHe was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\\nIt was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\\nFinally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .\\nMr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .\\nAs well he has complained of some

Medical Center .\\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .\\n2. Hypertension .\\n3. Status post hernia repair .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .\\n5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .\\nHead , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :\\nnegative .\\nNeck was supple .\\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\\n2+ carotids without bruits .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .\\nExtremities :\\nthe patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .\\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\\nSodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .\\nThe patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\\nThe graft used was a homograft .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nDiet :\\nHigh calorie , high protein .\\nThe patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .\\nThe patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nThe patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .\\nThe patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .\\nThe patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.\\n2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .\\n5. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n6. Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .\\n8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .\\n9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .\\nFOLLOWUP :\\nThe patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .\\nThe patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .\\nThe patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .\\nThe patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .\\nThe patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .\\nDr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .\\nRYNA DAU , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nNISTE MA RHALT , M.D.\\nTR :\\noq\\nDD :\\n09/13/1998\\nTD :\\n09/13/1998 7:18 A\\ncc :\\nKEND N BOTH , M.D. CARDIAC FELLOWS ROOM LOLI MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER NACO MESPRHALT , M.D. INFECTIOUS DISEASE UNIT CIL HOSPITAL RYNA R DAU , M.D. SURGICAL RESIDENT SURG AG NISTE MA RHALT , M.D. SURGERY BROTROJEUNECOCK HEALTH CHPO E ENLA GENERAL , M.D. SURGERY ON HOSPITAL STAT EDITED 09/15/1998 RT\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

:\\n08/01/1998\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :\\n1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .\\n2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .\\n3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nOn May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .\\nShe was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .\\nOn May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .\\nHer oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .\\nChest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .\\nA VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .\\nOn May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .\\nAt this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nShe was started on a steroid trial at that point .\\nHer pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .\\nOn June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .\\nThe patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .\\nFrom May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .\\nOn June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .\\n2 ) Hypertension .\\n3 ) Status post hysterectomy .\\n4 ) Status post appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\n1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n2 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .\\n4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.\\n5 ) Thiamine .\\n6 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n8 ) Folic acid .\\n9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .\\n10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .\\n11 ) Insulin sliding scale .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient had no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is divorced .\\nShe has two children .\\nShe recently retired as a clerical worker .\\nShe denies any tobacco .\\nShe has only social alcohol use .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nFather died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .\\nMother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .\\nBrother has coronary artery disease .\\nThere is no family history of hematologic problems .\\nLABORATORY :\\nLaboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :\\nThe video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nThe patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .\\nThis was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\\nBy discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\\nThe patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\\nRepeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\\nAt the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\\n2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\\nThe patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .\\nShe was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .\\nHer platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .\\nHer LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .\\nShe continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .\\nThe patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .\\nEventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .\\nAfter this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .\\nIt is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .\\nShe will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .\\n3 ) Renal :\\nThe patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .\\nThroughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\\nThe opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\\nShe required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\\nDuring the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .\\n4 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .\\nThe patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .\\nShe received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .\\nIn addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .\\nShe also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .\\nShe was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .\\nThe patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .\\n5 ) Rheumatology :\\nThe patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nUnfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .\\nA repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\n1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .\\n2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .\\nThe nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .\\n3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .\\n4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .\\nThe left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .\\nShe would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .\\n5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .\\n6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .\\n7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .\\n8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455

one tablet daily and Albuterol nebulizers qid .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease .\\nShe does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .\\nShe has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .\\nShe denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .\\nOn the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .\\nHer sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .\\nThe electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .\\nRight sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .\\nShe was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed .\\nThe blood sugar was elevated at 208 .\\nThe BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .\\nThe uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .\\nWhen she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .\\nIn the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .\\nThe electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .\\nShe had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .\\nHer only medication was Dyazide .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .\\nThe pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .\\nThe respirations 18 and she was afebrile .\\nThe jugular veins were not distended .\\nThe carotids were full .\\nThere were no bruits .\\nThe chest was clear with distant breath sounds .\\nThe cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .\\nThere were no rubs .\\nThe abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .\\nThere was no peripheral edema .\\nThere were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .\\nThere was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .\\nHer electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .\\nThe cholesterol was 171 .\\nTriglycerides 103 .\\nBy this time her CK was 600 .\\nHer hematocrit was 37.1 .\\nHemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .\\nThe PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .\\nReview of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .\\nShe was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .\\nShe was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe became increasingly disoriented .\\nShe developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\\nThe chest films showed mild cephalization .\\nShe became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .\\nShe went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .\\nShe had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .\\nCatheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .\\nThe right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .\\nShe had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\\nShe continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\\nDobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\\nShe was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .\\nShe was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .\\nEventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .\\nShe had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .\\nShe was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .\\nThe BUN rose to 91 .\\nHer Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .\\nShe was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .\\nEfforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .\\nThe right ventricular function was normal .\\nAfter extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\\nThere was no structural abnormality .\\nMoistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\\nShe continued a rather slow improvement .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .\\nThe possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .\\nShe had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nRenal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\\nShe had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\\nThat can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nBecause of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\\nThis was followed up and was shown to resolve .\\nMR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\\nA MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\\nShe was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nSHASQUALENA R.

:\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n2/15/94\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n2/28/94\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .\\nApparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .\\nHe came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .\\nHe had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .\\nHe became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .\\nOther medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .\\nHe also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .\\nHe had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .\\nThere were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .\\nHe had no cardiac murmur .\\nHis abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .\\nThe neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nIncluded a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .\\nThere were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .\\nThe platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .\\nHis prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .\\nHis uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .\\nThere was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .\\nAn electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .\\nHe did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .\\nHe also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .\\nHis headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .\\nThere was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .\\nTransfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .\\nAmicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .\\nA bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .\\nHe was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .\\nThe renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .\\nThe family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .\\nHe was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .\\nThey agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .\\nNo autopsy was obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nlj / bmot\\nDD :\\n3/12/94\\nTD :\\n03/13/94\\nCC :\\nDr. Ca Shuff , FIH Oregon Dr. Ille Kote\\n[ report_end ]\\n\")],\n",

Chronic leg pain and weakness of uncertain etiology\\n7. Chronic obstructive lung disease ( former smoker )\\n8. Chronic anemia ( multifactorial )\\n9. Hyperlipidemia\\n10. History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nNone\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThis is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\\nThere were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\\nShe had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\\nThe patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\\nThe weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\\nHer appetite was gone .\\nShe was having some nausea .\\nNo recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\\nNo changes in her breathing .\\nShe did not seem sleepy or confused .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\\nWeight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\\nTemperature 97 .\\nThe patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\\nShe could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\\nShe has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nheart ; without murmur or gallop .\\nHer jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\\nsoft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nShe had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\\nShe was moving all four extremities .\\nHer cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nHematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\\nOver the following days , she was gently hydrated .\\nHer urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\\nShe was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\\nIn the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\\nShe tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\\nThe patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\\nThe family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\\nThey did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\\nBy the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\\nOn the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\\nThere had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\\nPotassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\\nShe was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\\nThe problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\\nThe patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\\nThe patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\\nShe will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\\n2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\\nshe also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\\n5. Metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs PO b.i.d.\\n6. Calcium acetate ( Phos-Lo ) 667 mgs PO t.i.d.\\n7. Trazodone 25 mics PO q.h.s.\\n8. Neurontin 100 mics PO q.h.s.\\n9.

Dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs PO b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .\\nThe next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on Wednesday , Oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by November 25 , 2003 .\\n13. Ranitidine 75 mgs PO b.i.d.\\n14. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs PO t.i.d.\\n15. Hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.\\n16. Furosemide 40 mgs PO b.i.d.\\nThe patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters PO q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .\\nThe patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .\\nThe patient should have an arranged visit to see Dr. Lyn Ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately Friday , Oct 15 , 2003 LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\\n11/04/2003 12:18\\n_____________________________ LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nkxs\\nDD :\\n10/02/2003\\nTD :\\n10/03/2003 9:49 A 437894\\ncc :\\nLYN MEARD SCALE , M.D. /STAT\\n[ report_end ]\\n\"),\n",

.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nLipitor .\\nLopressor .\\nAspirin .\\nImdur .\\nNitroglycerin prn .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient lives with is wife .\\nTOBACCO :\\nHistory of heavy smoking in the past .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nBlood pressure 112 , Sa02 96% , afebrile .\\nLungs clear .\\nS1 , S2 .\\nNo significant murmurs .\\nAbdomen :\\nObese and soft .\\nExtremities :\\nWithout edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .\\nHe became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHowever , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nIn the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\\nHe was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\\nHe was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\\nThe circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\\nThe right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\\nA balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\\nThe patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\\nThe procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\\nThe distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\\nA good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\\nHis peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\\nThe patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\\nHe underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\\nIn addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\\nIt was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\\nIn addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\\nHead CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\\nIn addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\\nThe patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\\nThis was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\\nHe tolerated it well .\\nThe ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\\nThe patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHe had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\\nHe was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\\nHe is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\\nAt the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\\nHe has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\\nOf note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\\nElectronically Signed RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D. 02/17/2002 11:29\\n_____________________________ RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nfb\\nDD :\\n02/06/2002\\nTD

.\\nThe sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam .\\nReflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .\\nThe SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .\\nLactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .\\nHematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .\\nThe MCV is 88 .\\nThe prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .\\nThe urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .\\nThe CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .\\nThe urine sodium was 147 .\\nThe serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .\\nAn I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .\\nThe abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .\\nChest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .\\nHe was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .\\n1-Rhabdomyolysis .\\nThe patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .\\nThis resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .\\nThe patient \\'s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .\\nThe aldolase was positive at 142 .\\nThis was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .\\nThe patient \\'s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .\\nThe patient \\'s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .\\nNevertheless , the patient \\'s renal failure continued to progress .\\nOver the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .\\nMuch of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .\\n2-Renal failure .\\nThe creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .\\nThe urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .\\nPeritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .\\nSubsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .\\nHe continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .\\n3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .\\nOn admission the patient \\'s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .\\nHe went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .\\nThe patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .\\nHis DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .\\n4-Septic shock .\\nThe patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\\nThis will be discussed below .\\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\\n5-Hepatic failure .\\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .\\nGiven his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .\\n6-Cocaine intoxication .\\nSerum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .\\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .\\n7-Pneumonia .\\nThe patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .\\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .\\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\\n8-Pancreatitis .\\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\\n9-Catheter tip infections .\\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\\n10-Anemia .\\nThe patient \\'s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\\n11-Coma .\\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient \\'s persistent coagulopathy .\\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nCocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .\\nCOMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :\\nNeck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nNone .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient was discharged to Samfer Street with no autopsy .\\nLENNI HEAD , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbe

the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\\nFor a short time , she seemed \" locked in \" .\\nShe has

hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient \\'s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient \\'s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as

degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\\nThe chest films showed mild cephalization .\\nShe became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .\\nShe went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .\\nShe had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .\\nCatheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .\\nThe right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .\\nShe had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\\nShe continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\\nDobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\\nShe was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .\\nShe was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .\\nEventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .\\nShe had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .\\nShe was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .\\nThe BUN rose to 91 .\\nHer Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .\\nShe was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .\\nEfforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .\\nThe right ventricular function was normal .\\nAfter extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\\nThere was no structural abnormality .\\nMoistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\\nShe continued a rather slow improvement .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .\\nThe possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .\\nShe had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nRenal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\\nShe had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\\nThat can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nBecause of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\\nThis was followed up and was shown to resolve .\\nMR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\\nA MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\\nShe was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nSHASQUALENA R.

:\\n07-01-93\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n07-26-93\\nDISCHARGED TO SOUTHOBASSKING'S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nAcute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\\nAscending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\n7/21/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .\\nOTHER PROCEDURES :\\n06/29/93 - white cell scan ; 07/03/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .\\nThere were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .\\nShe was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .\\nBecause of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to O Center in Sondibrid Ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .\\nBlood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .\\nHer antibiotics were appropriately changed .\\nAt the family 's request , the patient was transferred to Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for further evaluation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nFurther evaluation at Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .\\nHer antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .\\nCardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .\\nThere was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .\\nShe was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .\\nThe patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .\\nShe was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .\\nThere was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .\\nIn addition , she was evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .\\nShe had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .\\nBecause of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .\\nHer temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .\\nTowards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .\\nA rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .\\nOn 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .\\nShe was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .\\nHer cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .\\nAfter considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient 's care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .\\nAlso , no source for sepsis had been found .\\nBecause of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone 's opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .\\nAccordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .\\nDuring her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .\\nShe , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .\\nHer valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .\\nIt was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .\\nHer valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .\\nShe weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .\\nShe was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .\\nIn the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .\\nThe sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .\\nShe was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .\\nHer sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .\\nWith clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .\\nShe subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .\\nShe remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .\\nDespite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .\\nAfter consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m.\\nAutopsy permission was granted .\\nRIEMUND C.

left .\\nShe answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________\\nShe appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .\\nHer liver function tests were all within normal limits .\\nHer coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .\\nHer white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .\\nThe hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .\\nThe differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .\\nAbdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .\\nThe electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .\\nHead CT scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .\\nAs noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .\\nWork up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .\\nIn concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .\\nAn lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .\\nIn addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .\\nIn addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .\\nFor her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .\\nFor her FEN , the patient was able to take PO 's and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO 's with one to one supervision .\\nFor prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .\\nFrom an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .\\nNo obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .\\nExcellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .\\nHowever , these antibodies were both within normal limits .\\nThe patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .\\nHowever , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .\\nThe nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .\\nOn the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .\\nCA-125 levels were within normal limits .\\nWe entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .\\nWe will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .\\nPending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .\\nLENNI E.

Status post mitral valve replacement , with a porcine valve , and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery .\\n4. Chronic obstructive lung disease .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\nA temporary pacemaker on 5/4/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on 5/5/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on 5/6/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nZestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace .\\nShe had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. 's .\\nShe subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .\\nShe had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.\\nHer ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .\\nIn 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .\\nShe had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .\\nShe , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .\\nDr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .\\nA TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .\\nNevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .\\nThe observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .\\nThis was on diltiazem and digoxin .\\nAt the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .\\nBecause of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .\\nWe could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .\\nOver the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .\\nShe also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .\\nTherefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .\\nA cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .\\nIt showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .\\nThe graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .\\nThe left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .\\nThere was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .\\nThe mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .\\nThus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .\\nWith this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .\\nA permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .\\nThis was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well .\\nOn diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .\\nOn this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .\\nWe will ambulate her over the next couple of days .\\nWe have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .\\nIf she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce .\\nEM Z.

ORTHOPEDICS :\\nThe patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .\\nHe is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .\\nHe received Ancef preoperatively .\\nPhysical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .\\nBrittle bones were noted during the operation .\\nA bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .\\n2. NEUROLOGICAL :\\nThe patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .\\n3. CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nNo chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .\\nThe patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .\\nCardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .\\nAn adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .\\nA small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .\\nAn echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .\\nCardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .\\nCardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .\\nAfter his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .\\nMB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient 's beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .\\n4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :\\nGI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .\\nUpper endoscopy x 2 were done .\\nThe first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .\\nThe stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .\\nIt was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .\\nA second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .\\nA gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .\\nThis report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .\\nThe patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .\\nI have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .\\nThe patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .\\nThe patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .\\n5.

.\\n6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .\\n7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .\\n8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 59-year-old white male .\\nThe patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .\\nHe underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nAt that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .\\nThis bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .\\nIn 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .\\nA workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .\\nAccording to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .\\nHe was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .\\nHe has been on Decadron since 08/94 .\\nAbout two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .\\nHe also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .\\nHe stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .\\nAn MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .\\nThere was evidence of cord compression .\\nThe patient 's Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nHowever , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\\nOver the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient 's right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\\nHe has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\\nHe also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\\nAt the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nHe was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .\\nBlood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .\\nBlood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nHe was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .\\nA Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .\\nHe was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center 's Intensive Care Unit for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) Multiple myeloma .\\n2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\n3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .\\n4) Chronic renal insufficiency .\\n5) Chronically low platelet count .\\n6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 .\\n7) Hypothyroidism .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nPositive for diabetes mellitus .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried to a very supportive wife .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuestion of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .\\nHEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .\\nNeck supple , carotids without bruits .\\nCardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .\\nChest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .\\nAbdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nRectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .\\nExtremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .\\nThere was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .\\nNeurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .\\nCranial nerves intact .\\nMotor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .\\nStrength was decreased in both lower extremities .\\nCoordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .\\nGlucose 191 .\\nPT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .\\nMagnesium 1.7 .\\nUA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .\\nChest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .\\nAn MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\\nThere was no CSF density .\\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nBy problems -\\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\\nThe patient 's clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\\n3) ONCOLOGY :\\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\\nThe patient 's lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\\n6) RESPIRATORY :\\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\\n7) NUTRITION :\\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , Decadron 5 mg IV q6h , Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day , Colace

:\\n05-26-94\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nCean Leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the Morehegron Valley Hospital in Ville , Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .\\nMr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .\\nHe was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .\\nHe was treated at that time with TPA .\\nA subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .\\nHis ejection fraction was in the mid-50's.\\nBecause of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .\\nHe did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .\\nHe again did well until approximately late l992 .\\nSince that time , he has had multiple admissions to George'sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .\\nHe has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .\\nHe has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .\\nHe was admitted to George'sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .\\nHe was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .\\nThat was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .\\nBecause of Mr. Leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .\\nHis angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .\\nHe was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .\\nThere he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .\\nRepeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .\\nHe then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .\\nSpecifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .\\nFollowing the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .\\nHe had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .\\nHowever , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .\\nIt was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .\\nHe was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .\\nFollowing that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .\\nStarting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .\\nThis occurred at rest and with exercise .\\nHe had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .\\nHis medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .\\nHis most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .\\nHe had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .\\nBecause of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .\\nHis medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .\\nThere is no history of drug abuse or smoking .\\nOf note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's .\\nThere is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .\\nOf note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .\\nHis medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe looked generally well .\\nHis blood pressure l60/90 .\\nHis heart rate was 88 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was normal .\\nHis chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .\\nHis abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .\\nHis femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .\\nHe had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .\\nHis initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .\\nPotassium of 3.2 .\\nNormal chloride and CO2 .\\nHis BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .\\nGlucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .\\nHis fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .\\nHis liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .\\nHis hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .\\nHis sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nthe primary concern upon Mr. Leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .\\nIt was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .\\nTo that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .\\nThe right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .\\nThe left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .\\nCoronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .\\nThat is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .\\nImpression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .\\nHe was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .\\nAfter an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .\\nSpecifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .\\nThis was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach 's regiment .\\nSpecifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.\\nRepeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .\\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .\\nThese were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .\\nThere were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .\\nBecause of the ongoing nature of his pain .\\nMultiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .\\nHe was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .\\nHe was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .\\nAmlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .\\nThe rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .\\nProtein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .\\nProtein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .\\nPlasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .\\nFactor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .\\nThrombin time and repalase time were normal .\\nIt was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .\\nHis anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .\\nHis APC resistance was normal .\\nHe was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .\\nRheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .\\nHe had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .\\nIt was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .\\nHis compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .\\nBecause of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .\\nTo evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .\\nPrior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .\\nThat study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .\\nOn the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .\\nThat was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .\\nThis produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .\\nHe was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .\\nHe once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .\\nThis encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .\\nAfter extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .\\nThere a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .\\nOnce again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .\\nThe catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .\\nAfter extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .\\nTherefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .\\nHe tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .\\nHe had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTiclopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. Lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. Lasix 80 mg. q.d. Kayciel 60 meq b.i.d. Cimetidine 400 mg. b.i.d. Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d. and Lodopine 10 mg. q.d. a combination of Percocet , Morphine Sulfate elixir p.o. as needed .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. Unstable angina secondary to syndrome X .\\n2. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as epicardial coronary artery disease .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :\\nLeft thorascopic sympathectomy on May 21 and cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograph and left ventriculography on April 10 , 1994 .\\nTreadmill exercise testing X2 on May 13 and May 14 .\\nLeft stellate ganglion sympathetic block on 5/14/94 and placement of a low catheter with sympathetic block on October 27 .\\nTRI I.

Coli .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nMRI / MRA .\\nOTHER PROCEDURES :\\nEchocardiogram , neurovascular ultrasound .\\nHISTORY :\\nPatient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .\\nHe had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .\\nAt his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .\\nHe also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .\\nHis history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNotable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on Dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression '92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nDexedrine 5 mg per day and Motrin 600 mg tid .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .\\nHis temperatureis 98.9 .\\nHis pressure is 150/90 .\\nRate 76 .\\nRespirations 16 .\\nHe was edentulous .\\nHe had mild copper wiring .\\nHe has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .\\nHeart sounds were normal and regular .\\nBreath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .\\nHe had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .\\nAbdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .\\nHe had 2+ carotids , no bruits .\\nHe had gynecomastia .\\nRectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .\\nExtremities :\\n1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .\\nHe had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .\\nHis right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.\\nHis hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .\\nReflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .\\nHis tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .\\nHe occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .\\nMental state :\\nHe was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .\\nHe was mildly perseverative and inattentive .\\nCoordination :\\nhis fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .\\nHe was unable to stand without extensive assistance .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .\\nChest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .\\nOn the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nMr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .\\nHe underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .\\nHowever , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .\\nHe had normal cervical vertebral arteries .\\nTranscranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .\\nThe proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .\\nOver the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .\\nHe had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .\\nA computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .\\nMRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .\\nBecause of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .\\nHis systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .\\nHowever , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .\\nThis strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .\\nWhile in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .\\nHe also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .\\nIn terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .\\nHe was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .\\nI should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .\\nHe had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .\\nAdditionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .\\nHe was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .\\nAt this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .\\nWe anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .\\nHe will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol

On 7-29-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,\\n2. on 7-29-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to Dr. Duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .\\nThe patient initially presented in September of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .\\nShe subsequently underwent a right colectomy in September of 1992 for a Duke 's C-II moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .\\nShe subsequently recent adjuvant 5-FU and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in September of 1993 .\\nIn Thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .\\nPostoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in February of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in April of 1994 .\\nA computerized tomography scan obtained in April of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .\\nAfter two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .\\nThe computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .\\nPrior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .\\nThese demonstrated\\n1. portal vein patent ,\\n2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,\\n3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .\\nThe patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .\\nThe operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .\\nThe left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .\\nThe intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .\\nThe patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .\\nThere were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .\\nThe patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .\\nThe decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .\\nThe patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .\\nThe operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .\\nThe patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .\\nThe patient required blood pressure support with pressors .\\nDue to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .\\nThe patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .\\nThe abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .\\nThe patient continued to require transfusions .\\nThe patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .\\nThe ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .\\nThe urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .\\nAs the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .\\nThe study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .\\nDespite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94

History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nNone\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThis is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\\nThere were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\\nShe had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\\nThe patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\\nThe weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\\nHer appetite was gone .\\nShe was having some nausea .\\nNo recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\\nNo changes in her breathing .\\nShe did not seem sleepy or confused .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\\nWeight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\\nTemperature 97 .\\nThe patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\\nShe could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\\nShe has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nheart ; without murmur or gallop .\\nHer jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\\nsoft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nShe had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\\nShe was moving all four extremities .\\nHer cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nHematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\\nOver the following days , she was gently hydrated .\\nHer urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\\nShe was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\\nIn the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\\nShe tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\\nThe patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\\nThe family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\\nThey did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\\nBy the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\\nOn the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\\nThere had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\\nPotassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\\nShe was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\\nThe problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\\nThe patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\\nThe patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\\nShe will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\\n2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\\n4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\\nshe also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\\n5.

placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .\\nOn medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .\\nAn attempt at medical management was continued .\\nHowever , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission

pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\\nHowever , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\\nIn the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\\nHe was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\\nHe was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\\nThe circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\\nThe right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\\nA balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\\nThe patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\\nThe procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\\nThe distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\\nA good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\\nHis peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\\nThe patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\\nHe underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\\nIn addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\\nIt was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\\nIn addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\\nHead CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Neurology and

admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .\\nThe SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .\\nLactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .\\nHematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .\\nThe MCV is 88 .\\nThe prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .\\nThe urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .\\nThe CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .\\nThe urine sodium was 147 .\\nThe serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .\\nAn I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .\\nThe abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .\\nChest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .\\nHe was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .\\n1-Rhabdomyolysis .\\nThe patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .\\nThis resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .\\nThe patient \\'s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .\\nThe aldolase was positive at 142 .\\nThis was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .\\nThe patient \\'s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .\\nThe patient \\'s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .\\nNevertheless , the patient \\'s renal failure continued to progress .\\nOver the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .\\nMuch of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .\\n2-Renal failure .\\nThe creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .\\nThe urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .\\nPeritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .\\nSubsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .\\nHe continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .\\n3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .\\nOn admission the patient \\'s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .\\nHe went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .\\nThe patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .\\nHis DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .\\n4-Septic shock .\\nThe patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\\nThis will be discussed below .\\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\\n5-Hepatic failure .\\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .\\nGiven his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .\\n6-Cocaine intoxication .\\nSerum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .\\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .\\n7-Pneumonia .\\nThe patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .\\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .\\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\\n8-Pancreatitis .\\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\\n9-Catheter tip infections .\\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\\n10-Anemia .\\nThe patient \\'s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\\n11-Coma .\\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient \\'s persistent coagulopathy .\\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nCocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .\\nCOMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :\\nNeck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nNone .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient was discharged to Samfer Street with no autopsy .\\nLENNI HEAD , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbe

PO b.i.d.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is a one pack per day smoker for the last forty years , denies alcohol , is a former nurse with the Storm Mor Hospital And Medical Center .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHer blood pressure was 190/90 when I first saw her on her second hospital day .\\nShe was afebrile , in sinus rhythm , pulse 60 .\\nNeck supple .\\nLungs clear .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , without ectopy .\\nA II / VI systolic ejection murmur is at the base , minimal radiation to the carotids .\\nAbdomen :\\nsoft , without hepatosplenomegaly .\\nExtremities :\\nnormal pulses , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe neurological examination :\\npost angiogram her eyes were closed .\\nShe was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely .\\nShe was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .\\nShe maintained her fixation on the conversation well .\\nThe cranial nerve exam :\\npupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .\\nRight lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .\\nThe left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .\\nDisks were flat .\\nSensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .\\nSeventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .\\nSoft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .\\nTongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .\\nSensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .\\nMotor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .\\nQuadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right .\\nGastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .\\nTibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .\\nReflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient \\'s baseline .\\nCK \\'s were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .\\nA chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .\\nAdmitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .\\nShe was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .\\nA small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\\nFor a short time , she seemed \" locked in \" .\\nShe has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .\\nTrace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .\\n4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .\\nShe is unable to lift either foot off the bed .\\nThe extra ocular movements are full .\\nTongue protrudes 4 cm .\\nShe is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .\\nShe has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .\\nShe has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .\\nShe is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .\\nShe is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .\\nFollow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient \\'s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient \\'s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg.

daily and Albuterol nebulizers qid .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease .\\nShe does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .\\nShe has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .\\nShe denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .\\nOn the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .\\nHer sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .\\nThe electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .\\nRight sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .\\nShe was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed .\\nThe blood sugar was elevated at 208 .\\nThe BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .\\nThe uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .\\nWhen she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .\\nIn the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .\\nThe electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .\\nShe had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .\\nHer only medication was Dyazide .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .\\nThe pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .\\nThe respirations 18 and she was afebrile .\\nThe jugular veins were not distended .\\nThe carotids were full .\\nThere were no bruits .\\nThe chest was clear with distant breath sounds .\\nThe cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .\\nThere were no rubs .\\nThe abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .\\nThere was no peripheral edema .\\nThere were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .\\nThere was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .\\nHer electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .\\nThe cholesterol was 171 .\\nTriglycerides 103 .\\nBy this time her CK was 600 .\\nHer hematocrit was 37.1 .\\nHemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .\\nThe PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .\\nReview of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .\\nShe was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .\\nShe was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe became increasingly disoriented .\\nShe developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\\nThe chest films showed mild cephalization .\\nShe became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .\\nShe went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .\\nShe had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .\\nCatheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .\\nThe right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .\\nShe had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\\nShe continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\\nShe remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\\nDobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\\nShe was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .\\nShe was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .\\nEventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .\\nShe had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .\\nShe was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .\\nThe BUN rose to 91 .\\nHer Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .\\nShe was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .\\nEfforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .\\nThe right ventricular function was normal .\\nAfter extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\\nThere was no structural abnormality .\\nMoistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\\nShe continued a rather slow improvement .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .\\nThe possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .\\nShe had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nRenal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\\nShe had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\\nThat can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nBecause of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\\nThis was followed up and was shown to resolve .\\nMR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\\nA MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\\nShe was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .\\nSHASQUALENA R.

ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .\\nShe was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .\\nThere were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .\\nShe was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .\\nBecause of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to O Center in Sondibrid Ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .\\nBlood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .\\nHer antibiotics were appropriately changed .\\nAt the family 's request , the patient was transferred to Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for further evaluation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nFurther evaluation at Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .\\nHer antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .\\nCardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .\\nThere was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .\\nShe was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .\\nThe patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .\\nShe was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .\\nThere was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .\\nIn addition , she was evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .\\nShe had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .\\nBecause of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .\\nHer temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .\\nTowards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .\\nA rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .\\nOn 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .\\nShe was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .\\nHer cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .\\nAfter considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient 's care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .\\nAlso , no source for sepsis had been found .\\nBecause of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone 's opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .\\nAccordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .\\nDuring her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .\\nShe , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .\\nHer valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .\\nIt was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .\\nHer valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .\\nShe weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .\\nShe was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .\\nIn the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .\\nThe sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .\\nShe was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .\\nHer sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .\\nWith clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .\\nShe subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .\\nShe remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .\\nDespite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was

give her name , but did respond when her name was used .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .\\nHer liver function tests were all within normal limits .\\nHer coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .\\nHer white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .\\nThe hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .\\nThe differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .\\nAbdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .\\nThe electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .\\nHead CT scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .\\nAs noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .\\nWork up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .\\nIn concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .\\nAn lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .\\nIn addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .\\nIn addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .\\nFor her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .\\nFor her FEN , the patient was able to take PO 's and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO 's with one to one supervision .\\nFor prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .\\nFrom an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .\\nNo obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .\\nExcellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .\\nHowever , these antibodies were both within normal limits .\\nThe patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .\\nHowever , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .\\nThe nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .\\nOn the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .\\nCA-125 levels were within normal limits .\\nWe entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .\\nWe will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .\\nPending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .\\nLENNI E.

Chronic obstructive lung disease .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\nA temporary pacemaker on 5/4/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on 5/5/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on 5/6/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nZestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace .\\nShe had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. 's .\\nShe subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .\\nShe had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.\\nHer ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .\\nIn 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .\\nShe had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .\\nShe , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .\\nDr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .\\nA TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .\\nNevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .\\nThe observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .\\nThis was on diltiazem and digoxin .\\nAt the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .\\nBecause of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .\\nWe could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .\\nOver the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .\\nShe also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .\\nTherefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .\\nA cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .\\nIt showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .\\nThe graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .\\nThe left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .\\nThere was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .\\nThe mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .\\nThus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .\\nWith this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .\\nA permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .\\nThis was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well .\\nOn diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .\\nOn this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .\\nWe will ambulate her over the next couple of days .\\nWe have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .\\nIf she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce .\\nEM Z.

non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nRectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .\\nExtremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .\\nThere was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .\\nNeurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .\\nCranial nerves intact .\\nMotor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .\\nStrength was decreased in both lower extremities .\\nCoordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .\\nGlucose 191 .\\nPT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .\\nMagnesium 1.7 .\\nUA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .\\nChest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .\\nAn MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\\nThere was no CSF density .\\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nBy problems -\\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\\nThe patient 's clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\\n3) ONCOLOGY :\\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\\nThe patient 's lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\\n6) RESPIRATORY :\\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\\n7) NUTRITION :\\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , Decadron 5 mg IV q6h , Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day , Colace

:\\n05-26-94\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nCean Leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the Morehegron Valley Hospital in Ville , Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .\\nMr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .\\nHe was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .\\nHe was treated at that time with TPA .\\nA subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .\\nHis ejection fraction was in the mid-50's.\\nBecause of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .\\nHe did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .\\nHe again did well until approximately late l992 .\\nSince that time , he has had multiple admissions to George'sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .\\nHe has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .\\nHe has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .\\nHe was admitted to George'sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .\\nHe was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .\\nThat was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .\\nBecause of Mr. Leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .\\nHis angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .\\nHe was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .\\nThere he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .\\nRepeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .\\nHe then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .\\nSpecifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .\\nFollowing the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .\\nHe had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .\\nHowever , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .\\nIt was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .\\nHe was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .\\nFollowing that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .\\nStarting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .\\nThis occurred at rest and with exercise .\\nHe had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .\\nHis medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .\\nHis most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .\\nHe had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .\\nBecause of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .\\nHis medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .\\nThere is no history of drug abuse or smoking .\\nOf note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's .\\nThere is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .\\nOf note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .\\nHis medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe looked generally well .\\nHis blood pressure l60/90 .\\nHis heart rate was 88 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was normal .\\nHis chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .\\nHis abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .\\nHis femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .\\nHe had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .\\nHis initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .\\nPotassium of 3.2 .\\nNormal chloride and CO2 .\\nHis BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .\\nGlucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .\\nHis fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .\\nHis liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .\\nHis hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .\\nHis sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nthe primary concern upon Mr. Leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .\\nIt was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .\\nTo that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .\\nThe right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .\\nThe left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .\\nCoronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .\\nThat is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .\\nImpression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .\\nHe was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .\\nAfter an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .\\nSpecifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .\\nThis was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach 's regiment .\\nSpecifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.\\nRepeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .\\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .\\nThese were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .\\nThere were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .\\nBecause of the ongoing nature of his pain .\\nMultiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .\\nHe was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .\\nHe was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .\\nAmlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .\\nThe rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .\\nProtein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .\\nProtein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .\\nPlasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .\\nFactor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .\\nThrombin time and repalase time were normal .\\nIt was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .\\nHis anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .\\nHis APC resistance was normal .\\nHe was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .\\nRheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .\\nHe had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .\\nIt was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .\\nHis compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .\\nBecause of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .\\nTo evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .\\nPrior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .\\nThat study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .\\nOn the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .\\nThat was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .\\nThis produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .\\nHe was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .\\nHe once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .\\nThis encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .\\nAfter extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .\\nThere a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .\\nOnce again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .\\nThe catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .\\nAfter extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .\\nTherefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .\\nHe tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .\\nHe had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTiclopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. Lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. Lasix 80 mg. q.d. Kayciel 60 meq b.i.d. Cimetidine 400 mg. b.i.d. Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d. and Lodopine 10 mg. q.d. a combination of Percocet , Morphine Sulfate elixir p.o. as needed .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. Unstable angina secondary to syndrome X .\\n2. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as epicardial coronary artery disease .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :\\nLeft thorascopic sympathectomy on May 21 and cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograph and left ventriculography on April 10 , 1994 .\\nTreadmill exercise testing X2 on May 13 and May 14 .\\nLeft stellate ganglion sympathetic block on 5/14/94 and placement of a low catheter with sympathetic block on October 27 .\\nTRI I.

myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .\\nHe had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .\\nAt his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .\\nHe also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .\\nHis history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNotable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on Dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression '92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nDexedrine 5 mg per day and Motrin 600 mg tid .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .\\nHis temperatureis 98.9 .\\nHis pressure is 150/90 .\\nRate 76 .\\nRespirations 16 .\\nHe was edentulous .\\nHe had mild copper wiring .\\nHe has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .\\nHeart sounds were normal and regular .\\nBreath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .\\nHe had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .\\nAbdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .\\nHe had 2+ carotids , no bruits .\\nHe had gynecomastia .\\nRectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .\\nExtremities :\\n1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .\\nHe had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .\\nHis right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.\\nHis hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .\\nReflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .\\nHis tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .\\nHe occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .\\nMental state :\\nHe was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .\\nHe was mildly perseverative and inattentive .\\nCoordination :\\nhis fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .\\nHe was unable to stand without extensive assistance .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .\\nChest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .\\nOn the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nMr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .\\nHe underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .\\nHowever , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .\\nHe had normal cervical vertebral arteries .\\nTranscranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .\\nThe proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .\\nOver the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .\\nHe had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .\\nA computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .\\nMRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .\\nBecause of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .\\nHis systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .\\nHowever , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .\\nThis strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .\\nWhile in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .\\nHe also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .\\nIn terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .\\nHe was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .\\nI should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .\\nHe had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .\\nAdditionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .\\nHe was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .\\nAt this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .\\nWe anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .\\nHe will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol

On 7-29-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,\\n2. on 7-29-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to Dr. Duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .\\nThe patient initially presented in September of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .\\nShe subsequently underwent a right colectomy in September of 1992 for a Duke 's C-II moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .\\nShe subsequently recent adjuvant 5-FU and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in September of 1993 .\\nIn Thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .\\nPostoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in February of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in April of 1994 .\\nA computerized tomography scan obtained in April of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .\\nAfter two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .\\nThe computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .\\nPrior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .\\nThese demonstrated\\n1. portal vein patent ,\\n2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,\\n3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .\\nThe patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .\\nThe operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .\\nThe left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .\\nThe intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .\\nThe patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .\\nThere were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .\\nThe patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .\\nThe decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .\\nThe patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .\\nThe operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .\\nThe patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .\\nThe patient required blood pressure support with pressors .\\nDue to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .\\nThe patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .\\nThe abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHowever , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .\\nThe patient continued to require transfusions .\\nThe patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .\\nThe ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .\\nThe urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .\\nAs the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .\\nThe study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .\\nDespite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94

time , showed a right lower lung pneumonia , and he was started on Keflex .\\nSince the 12th of October , to the day of admission , the patient continued to have symptoms , including fever as high as 101.4 , with worsening coughs and sputum .\\nOn the morning of admission , he developed increased shortness of breath , along with flecks of blood in his sputum .\\nHe then reported to the Emergency

, and social alcohol use .\\nHe denies intravenous drug use .\\nHe says that he has not had sexual activity for 30 years .\\nHe lives with his friend , who is healthy .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nElderly white male in no acute distress , with nasal cannula oxygen .\\nHis temperature was 99.8 , with a heart rate of 79 , blood pressure 140/90 , respiration rate of 20 .\\nHis saturation on 4 liters of oxygen was 89% .\\nHEENT :\\nPupils were equal , round and reactive to light .\\nExtraocular movements were intact .\\nOropharynx was clear and dry .\\nHis dentition was OK .\\nNECK :\\nJugular veins were flat .\\nCarotids showed 2+ upstroke , no bruits .\\nThere was full range of motion .\\nNo thyromegaly .\\nLUNGS :\\nDecreased breath sounds at the right base with E to A changes in the right base and laterally .\\nThere was no dullness to percussion noted , however , with the exception of the right base .\\nCARDIOVASCULAR :\\nRegular rate and rhythm with an S1 noted clearly , with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft .\\nNondistended and nontender .\\nThere was no visceromegaly noted .\\nHis bowel sounds were present and normoactive .\\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nIn addition , a well-healed scar at the right costovertebral angle was noted , consistent with his history of nephrectomy .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nThere was evidence for chronic venous changes on his lower extremities .\\nHis pulses were 2+ .\\nThere was no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNEURO :\\nNonfocal .\\nRECTAL :\\nGuaiac negative , good anal tone .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 128 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 87 , bicarb 24 , BUN 27 , creatinine 1.1 , and glucose 105 .\\nIn addition , his LDH was elevated to 323 .\\nHis ALT was 33 , his AST was 50 .\\nAlkaline phosphatase of 81 .\\nBilirubin of 0.8 .\\nHis white count was 14.9 , hematocrit 41.7 , platelet count of 487 .\\nHis coagulation profile was within normal limits .\\nChest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the 14th , with a tiny effusion on the 20th , the night of admission .\\nThe pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .\\nSputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .\\nHis electrocardiogram was within normal limits .\\nHis urine sediment was basically within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .\\nThe differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .\\n(1) Pneumonia .\\nHe was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .\\nThe pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .\\nHe was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .\\nHowever , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .\\nIn addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .\\nHis urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .\\nHowever , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .\\nHowever , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .\\nTherefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .\\nIn addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .\\nAfter admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .\\nHowever , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .\\nBecause of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .\\nTherefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .\\nThe chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .\\nHis sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\\nTherefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .\\nDespite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .\\nIt should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .\\nAdditionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.\\n(2) Hypertension .\\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .\\n(3) Hyponatremia .\\nWhile in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's Profile 7 labs .\\nIt was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .\\nWhile in the hospital , there were no complications .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAugmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nHis condition on discharge was stable .\\nHe was discharged to home .\\nHe has a followup appointment with Dr. Naaan Jesc , in the Tonwe Hospital Pulmonary Clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint .\\nHis estimated disability is mild .\\nWe are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .\\nDictated By :\\nNASA LINKEWEERTSJESCLEASK , M.D. CO23\\nAttending :\\nRYBAM T.

represented ischemia , there was a low clinical suspicion for this .\\nIt was most likely felt that the patient 's chest pain was reflective of her abdominal gastroenteritis .\\nHowever , she was

to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease .\\nAlthough the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical

grew out Group B strep and staph epi .\\nAs the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant .\\nTwo additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and Flagyl .\\nAfter 48 hours , all other blood cultures remained negative and the patient continued to be afebrile .\\nThe antibiotics were discontinued , she was observed and remained afebrile .\\nGynecologic :\\nThe patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles .\\nA FSH level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation .\\nThe gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap

stopped because of leg and back pain .\\nImpression was that the study showed no evidence of ischemia .\\nHistory of syphilis :\\nThe patient was treated for syphilis in the 1970's .\\nRPR during this admission was reactive .\\nThe RPR titer itself was pending at the time of dictation .\\nBecause of the positive RPR titer , FTA was automatically sent off .\\nHowever , the usefulness of the FTA is questionable .\\nThe patient should have a follow-up of her RPR titer .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn discharge included Procardia XL , 90 mg po q a.m .\\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition .\\nThe patient will have follow-up in the Kingsec Li Hospital with Dr. Boop on 12/10/92 .\\nKV968/1032 AYAN NO , M.D. XA4\\nD :\\n11/28/92\\nBatch :\\n4212\\nReport :\\nZ1010S54\\nT

the time .\\nIn the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .\\nThe patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .\\nOver the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .\\nStat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .\\nThe patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nOnly noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nNone .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY

10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .\\nPlatelets 310 .\\nPT and PTT were normal .\\nLFT 's were within normal limits .\\nAdmission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .\\nChest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nIn the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .\\nEchocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .\\nThe patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .\\nBecause the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .\\nAll cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .\\nThe infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .\\nThe patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .\\nBecause Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .\\nHowever , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .\\nThe patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .\\nAlso , TSH was normal on admission .\\nThyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .\\nHowever , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .\\nEMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .\\nAdditional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .\\nOther studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .\\nLH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .\\nGalactin levels were within normal limits .\\nANA was negative .\\nAce level was negative .\\nHeavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .\\nAn anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .\\nOn hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .\\nAt that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .\\nHer initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .\\nIn the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .\\nThe patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .\\nSubsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .\\nBecause of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .\\nHowever , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .\\nThe patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .\\nPrior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .\\nBecause the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .\\nA new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .\\nShe will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .\\nMulti-vitamin one

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMayta Neek is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. Queszucenove Tadl at Cochusetts Medical Center .\\nHe presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .\\nHis first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .\\nHe had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .\\nHe presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .\\nHe had normal left ventricular function .\\nHe did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .\\nThe left main was normal .\\nThe LAD was also occluded .\\nThe circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .\\nThe LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .\\nThe snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .\\nFor this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .\\nHe had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .\\nHe had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .\\nThe LIMA was left from the first surgery .\\nHe did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .\\nHe had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .\\nHe did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .\\nHe therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .\\nHe also has had cataract repairs .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nHe has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHis social history is that he lives in Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota with his wife Second .\\nHe has four children .\\nHe is present in a Capefrecam Luhthousy .\\nHe does not drink and does not smoke .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .\\nHis blood pressure is 130/75 .\\nHis pulse is 50 and regular .\\nHis neck veins are not distended .\\nHis head and neck exam is normal .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .\\nHis abdomen is benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHis neurologic exam was nonfocal .\\nHe is fully oriented .\\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\\nIncludes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .\\nHematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .\\nThere , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .\\nThe LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .\\nThe vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .\\nThe culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .\\nThis was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .\\nIt was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .\\nLeft ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .\\nHe tolerated the procedure well .\\nHe was monitored for the day .\\nHe ambulated without difficulty .\\nHe was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital 's .\\nHe will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely

Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .\\nThe patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .\\nThe next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .\\nThis echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .\\nHowever , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .\\nIt was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .\\nThe patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .\\nThis responded to fluid bolus .\\nThe patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .\\nThe patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .\\nThis stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .\\nClearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .\\n2. Infectious Disease :\\nOn hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .\\nThe next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .\\nShe continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .\\nShe was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .\\nHer urine legionella antigen was negative .\\nOn 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .\\nShe was started on vancomycin for this .\\nThese bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .\\nShe had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .\\n3. GI :\\nThe patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .\\nGI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .\\nFinally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .\\nThe EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .\\nHer stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .\\n4. Shortness of breath :\\nAs mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .\\nAt most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .\\nThis was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .\\n5. Derm :\\nSeveral days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .\\nShe was started on some Miconazole Cream .\\nThe rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .\\nThe rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nTums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .\\nAlbuterol inhaler .\\nLipitor , 20 daily .\\nProzac , 60 daily .\\nFlovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .\\nAtrovent , two puffs qid .\\nDitropan , 5 mg tid .\\nColace , 100 mg tid .\\nAspirin , 325 mg daily .\\nInsulin NPH , 36 subcu q AM , 30 subcu q PM .\\nNystatin Mouthwash Swish and Swallow .\\nNexium , 20 mg PO daily .\\nVancomycin 1 gm IV q12h .\\nThe patient will follow-up with her primary care provider , Dr. Na Fongbain at the Cord Memorial Hospital .\\nIEVE MANUAL , MD\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed IEVE MANUAL , MD 12/23/2004 11:19\\n_____________________________ IEVE MANUAL , MD\\nTR :\\nmm\\nDD :\\n11/25/2004\\nTD :\\n11/25/2004 8:49 P 367017\\ncc :\\nIEVE MANUAL , MD\\n[ report_end ]\\n\"),\n",

there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .\\nMental status - her speech was fluent without errors .\\nHer affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .\\nHer memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .\\nVisual fields were full to confrontation .\\nHer left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .\\nHer right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .\\nHer extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .\\nThere was no nystagmus and no ptosis .\\nHer saccades were normal .\\nFacial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .\\nHer tongue , uvula and palate were midline .\\nShoulder shrug was 5/5 power .\\nMotor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .\\nThere was no drift .\\nThere was normal bulk and tone .\\nShe had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .\\nSensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .\\nReflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .\\nThere was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman \\'s sign .\\nCoordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .\\nOn standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .\\nHer heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nWere unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .\\nHer erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .\\nHer coagulation parameters were normal .\\nHead CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient \\'s report , had been noted several months earlier .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .\\nShe had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .\\nPosterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .\\nOn the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .\\nShe was seen by the Psychiatry Service .\\nShe was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .\\nThe psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .\\nThe patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .\\nThis trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .\\nShe will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .\\nShe will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .\\nNIREGE MEMORY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbzo\\nDD :\\n03/29/97\\nTD :\\n03/31/97 12:36 P\\ncc :\\nNYRI A MEMORY , M.D.\\nASHELLRIETTE NESSASU THREATSVOT , M.D.\\nEJEAN NADARC FREIERMCHIRD , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n'),\n",

GI :\\nPatient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .\\nHe remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .\\nHe was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .\\nHis Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .\\nHe was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :\\nIn the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .\\nA small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .\\nAnother polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .\\nIn the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .\\nThe biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .\\nAlso of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .\\nPatient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .\\nHis last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .\\nHis last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .\\nConsideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .\\nThis was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .\\n2. Cardiovascular :\\nA :\\nIschemia :\\nPatient \\'s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .\\nOn discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .\\nB :\\nRhythm :\\nPatient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .\\nHeparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .\\nHis last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .\\nC :\\nValves :\\nPatient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .\\nHowever , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .\\nD :\\nPump :\\nPatient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .\\nHe was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .\\nHe subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .\\nOf note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nWas discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .\\nHe was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nHis final medications on discharge were as follows :\\nAspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .\\nOf note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nHe was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. Gilbert .\\neScription document :\\n4-9918752 IEEHttd Tel\\nDictated By :\\nNETPEAKE , SHIRLH\\nAttending :\\nJERGJESC , GROSRIANNE SISANDLEE Dictation ID 4535172\\nD :\\n12/22/03\\nT :\\n12/22/03\\n[ report_end ]\\n'),\n",

Glaucoma drops .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nblood pressure 118/75 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 , in no acute distress .\\nHead and neck exam was unremarkable , except for the right eye being patched over .\\nLungs were clear .\\nBreasts were unremarkable .\\nBack was nontender .\\nHeart exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm , jugular venous pressure was normal , no carotid bruit was noted ; murmur , rub , gallop , click and ectopy were absent .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nRectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithout clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis .\\nNormal pulses were palpated .\\nNeurologic exam :\\nthe patient was alert and oriented x 4 .\\nExtensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes .\\nThere was a touch an anosognosia .\\nCranial nerve exam :\\nvisual fields were full o.s. , visual acuity was 20/70 o.s.\\nPupil o.s. reacted to light .\\nEOMs with full range of movement , no nystagmus .\\nVIIth cranial nerve :\\ninferior left weak .\\nNo gag was present .\\nOtherwise normal CN 's .\\nDTRs showed a mild decrease in left biceps and brachioradialis reflexes , otherwise normal tone , symmetrical reflexes , downgoing toes .\\nMotor exam :\\n5+ throughout , except left hand intrinsic muscles were 4+ , 3+ in the middle digits .\\nNo atrophy was noted .\\nSensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception .\\nCerebellar exam :\\nfinger / to/nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel-to-shin was good with few errors .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nChest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities .\\nEKG :\\nleft bundle branch block .\\nUrinalysis was unremarkable .\\nBUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .\\nHer admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .\\nAlbumin 2.5 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\\nThis was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\\nThe possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\\nHer echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\\nPrevious echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .\\nHer Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .\\nThe patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .\\nShe was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .\\nHer exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .\\nHer pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .\\nShe needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .\\nIn addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .\\nIt is discontinued at the time of transport .\\nThe patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\\nDuring evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\\nOn our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\\nThere are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\\nAt the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\\nWhat follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\\nHer ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\\nMoreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\\nOur leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\\nAs I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\\nWhile mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\\nTwo possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\\nThese tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .\\nThe results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\\nThe patient has glaucoma .\\nHer medications are as listed below .\\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nPropanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d.

who was not complaining of pain .\\nHis vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .\\nThe carotids were without bruits .\\nCrackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nS3 and S4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .\\nThe point of maximal impulse was not palpable .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended

waves were noted .\\nPicture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .\\nHe underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .\\nHe also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .\\nThe renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .\\nThe impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .\\nNo evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .\\nOn 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .\\nMr. Ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be

dilated cardiomyopathy with history of intra-atrial thrombus .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nUndergone during this hospital admission was a left brachial artery embolectomy .\\nThe patient also underwent upper endoscopy and a left wrist fine needle aspiration .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 76 year old white male with a probable brachial artery embolism .\\nThe patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was previously on Coumadin because of a prior embolic cerebrovascular accident .\\nThe patient had his Coumadin discontinued in January 1992 secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nThe patient was swimming at 4:00 o 'clock this afternoon when he experienced left upper extremity pain and paralysis .\\nHe was evaluated at

explained to the patient and consent has been obtained .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room .\\nThe preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .\\nThe postoperative diagnosis , the same .\\nThe procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .\\nThe surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .\\nThe findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .\\nThere were no complications .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .\\nOn postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .\\nHe was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .\\nIn addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .\\nThe patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\\nHis assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nHe recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\\nThese recommendations were already underway .\\nConsequently we simply continued our management .\\nThe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\\nOn 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\\nDr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\\nDuring this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\\nHe had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\\nFollow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\\nThere was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .\\nThe stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .\\nFrom Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .\\nWe discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\\nIt was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\\nThat was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\\nGiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\\nThe findings were as follows .\\nThe principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\\nThe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .\\nIn the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\\nThere were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\\nThe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\\nNo biopsy was taken .\\nThe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\\nOn 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\\nFindings were :\\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\\nThere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\\nThe aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\\nThere was trace aortic insufficiency .\\nThe aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\\nThe left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .\\nThere was trace tricuspid insufficiency .\\nThere was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .\\nThere was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\\nThere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\\nThe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\\nHe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\\nOn 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\\nHe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\\nThe Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\\nJoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\\nJoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\\nThe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\\nA wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\\nThe patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\\nHe is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\\nToday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\\nYesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\\nToday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\\nConsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\\nThe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nIsordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d.\\nDitropan 5 mg. po q.i.d.\\nCimetidine 400 mg. PO b.i.d.\\nOmeprazole 20 mg. PO b.i.d.\\nColchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d.\\nPercocet 1 tablet po q. 4 to 6 hours prn and Coumadin 5 mg. po q.day .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to home today 9-1-25 .\\nHis plans for follow up include a return to the Maza Alllarow Healthcare Surgery Clinic on 6-21-92 , that is two and a half weeks from the day of discharge ( 6-4-92 ) .\\nHe is to see his primary medical doctor , Dr. Telshey Swatlleebtik in Ki Ave , Sapo on Tuesday , June 7 , 1992 , that is this coming Tuesday .\\nIt has been a pleasure serving Mr. Flytheleungfyfe and taking care of him .\\nHe is a very pleasant gentleman and it has also been a pleasure to deal with his primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood who is very accessible .\\nTOMEDANKELL FLOWAYLES , M.D.\\nTR :\\nag / bmot\\nDD :\\n6-4-92\\nTD :\\n06/07/92\\nCC :\\nDR.

Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .\\nAt that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .\\nThe admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .\\nThe patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .\\nOne month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .\\nThereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .\\nThis course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .\\nAn abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nBilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .\\nTwo days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .\\nOn this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .\\nShe was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs as detailed above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nShe is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .\\nALLERGIES :\\nShe is allergic to shellfish .\\nDRUG ALLERGIES :\\nShe has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nInclude Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\n( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .\\nShe was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .\\nHead and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .\\nShe had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .\\nHeart :\\nregular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .\\nAbdomen :\\nshowed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nPelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .\\nThe patient was occult blood negative .\\nExtremities :\\nshowed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .\\nHowever , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\n( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .\\nI and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\\nChest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nThe patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\\nShe also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\\nIt was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\\nLaboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\\nUrinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\\nIn view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\\nRepeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\\nRenal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\\nDr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\\nHe requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\\nNeither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\\nIn view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\\nAs a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\\nShe was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\\nSputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\\nOn the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\\nHer urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\\nHowever , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\\nOn 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\\nHer Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\\nOn June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\\nShe was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\\nIn view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\\nOn 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\\nUrinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\\nA Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\\nAn electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\\nNo computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\\nShe continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\\nOff her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\\nFor this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\\nThe mucosa appeared to be preserved .\\nIn addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\\nThe patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\\nThe patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\\nHer sensorium had cleared .\\nBecause of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .\\nThe patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\\nIn addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\\nShe was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\\nDespite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\\nA Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\\nOn conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\\nOn 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\\nAnd she was not given platelets in addition .\\nThroughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .\\nAfter much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .\\nOn August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .\\nOn June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .\\nThe PEG tube was found to be draining well .\\nShe was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .\\nThe patient 's prognosis is guarded .\\nHer current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nInclude omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.\\nShe will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .\\nThe patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .\\nIn addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nThe patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .\\nLONGKEND SAPSHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nSLAINEAEE S.

releases in 1982 and 1965.\\ncholecystectomy in 1967 .\\nHysterectomy in 1952 .\\nRight heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nwas noncontributory .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\nincluded Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThere were no known drug allergies .\\nHABITS :\\ndid not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .\\nChest was clear .\\nHeart had regular rate and rhythm .\\nNeck was supple without mass or bruits .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nCalves were nontender .\\nOn neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .\\nShe looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .\\nHer face was strong and symmetric .\\nShe felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .\\nHer extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .\\nShe sees light only od. which is chronic .\\nShe reads large print os.\\nHer tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .\\nShe could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .\\nShe also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .\\nHer grip is 5/5 bilaterally .\\nAnkle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .\\nA head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .\\nMRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .\\nThis revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .\\nThis was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nThe internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .\\nAfter much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .\\nThe patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .\\nThis showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .\\nOne coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nIt was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .\\nAlso the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .\\nTherefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .\\nTherefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .\\nAt this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .\\nTherefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .\\nThe patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .\\nHer pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .\\nHer consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\nPROCEDURES :\\nOn 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .\\n01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\\n01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nThere were no noted complications .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\ninclude heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. ,

patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .\\nTherefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .\\nIf the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .\\nThis may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nFOLLOW UP :\\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .\\nTOMEDANKELL WIRE , M.D. dictating for TELSHEY PEG ,

Chest CT scan .\\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\\nNone .\\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\\nNone .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\\nOver the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\\nHe has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\\nAlthough in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\\nThe patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\\nHe has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\\nHe does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\\nOn examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\\nHis blood pressure was 110/70 .\\nHeart was 82 and regular .\\nRespiratory rate was 16 .\\nHis jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\\nLungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\\nThe first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\\nThere was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\\nThere was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\\nThe extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\\nThe posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\\nAlbumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\\nThe chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\\nThe ECG was paced .\\nAn outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\\nThere was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\\nThe aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\\nLeft ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\\nThere was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\\nIn addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\\nWhile in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\\nThe patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\\nThe patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\\nIn addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\\nHe will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1.

was weaned without problems .\\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\\nHABITS :\\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\\nThere was no splenomegaly .\\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\\nTR :\\nyf / bmot\\nDD :\\n11-3-93\\nTD :\\n11/04/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Swatlleebtik Dr. Eri Lfsquarc\\n[ report_end

carcinoma .\\nRecently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .\\nPlain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .\\nThe bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nThe patient was admitted for further evaluation .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNote :\\npast medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .\\nThe patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .\\nHe had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nOn physical examination , vital signs were as above .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .\\nThe abdomen was benign with no masses felt .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\ngrade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .\\nThe rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nwithin normal limits .\\nThe neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .\\nCerebellar function was normal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nsignificant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .\\nDuring this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .\\nBone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .\\nThere was microvascular disease .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .\\nSpleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .\\nThere was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .\\nThe first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .\\nThis was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .\\nThe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\\nThus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\\nActually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\\nOn that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\\nBy 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\\nThe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\\nHe is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .\\nHe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .\\nEventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\\nTwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\\nIt was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\\nA central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\\nAfter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\\nThis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\\nCytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\\nThe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,\\n3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,\\n4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,\\n5. hypertension .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nPrilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .\\nThe patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .\\nThe patient is on diet as tolerated .\\nThere will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .\\nGUABENFRANDA D.

patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .\\nHe developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nHe denied any angina .\\nHe had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .\\nHis pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .\\nAn echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .\\nHe was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .\\nA Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .\\nHis coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .\\nHe also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .\\nOn June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .\\nHe was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .\\nHis ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .\\nHe did smoke up to three pack per day .\\nHe has three children .\\nHe is retired .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nSix foot , 250 pounds .\\nHe is a well appearing male , in no distress .\\nHIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .\\nHis neck veins were not distended .\\nHis carotids showed bilateral bruits .\\nHis lungs are clear .\\nHis cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis abdomen is obese , but benign .\\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\\nHe has no peripheral edema .\\nHis

bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .\\nhematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .\\nurinalysis was unremarkable .\\nHis chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .\\nThere were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .\\nThere , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .\\nThere was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\\nMAY A , M.D.\\nTR :\\not /

the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" Mattox \" maneuvers were performed .\\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer \\'s lactate .\\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\\nThe patient \\'s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient \\'s course .\\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nN / A.\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nN / A.\\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\\nN / A.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMason Street .\\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\\nTR :\\nun / bmot\\nDD :\\n08-07-93\\nTD :\\n08/08/93\\nCC :\\n[ report_end ]\\n'),\n",

excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n2/14/94 - tracheostomy .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .\\nHer work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .\\nHer x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .\\nShe underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .\\nShe was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n( 1 ) hysterectomy .\\n( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .\\n( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy

notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :\\ntiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nEarly in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .\\nHer oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\\nUpon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\\nThere were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\\nShe was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\\nShe underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\\nThese were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .\\nIntraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .\\nIt was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\\nThis proceeded uneventfully .\\nShe was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\\nHowever , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\\nThis appeared to be respiratory in origin .\\nShe was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\\nPressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .\\nHer blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\\nX-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\\nShe was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nEarly in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .\\nHer wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction .\\nShe developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\\nThis improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\\nShe remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\\nUltimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\\nHowever , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\\nThis improved her cardiac function .\\nShe failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\\nShe had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nThe right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .\\nShe had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .\\nShe was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .\\nGiven her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .\\nThis was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .\\nHer support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.\\nThe patient 's family was notified

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\\nHis CVP was 16 .\\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\\nHe also remained intubated .\\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\\nThe balloon pump was restored .\\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\\nSupportive care continued .\\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\\nCAGHALA R.

chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper

Neurological :\\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\\n2. Pulmonary :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\\n3. Cardiovascular :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\\n4. Renal :\\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\\n5. Gastrointestinal :\\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\\n6. Infectious disease :\\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\\nShe ruled out by PPD .\\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .\\nIN SUMMARY :\\nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable with issues resolving .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

PO q.d.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nBreunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .\\nShe is referred for progressive angina .\\nShe had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .\\nShe has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .\\nIn 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .\\nIn October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .\\nShe had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .\\nIn 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .\\nShe had exertional angina at that time .\\nIn November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .\\nShe had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .\\nSince that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .\\nShe was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .\\nBecause these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .\\nIn May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .\\nShe had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .\\nShe has had no syncope .\\nHer cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .\\nShe has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .\\nShe is a remote cigarette smoker .\\nShe also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .\\nShe has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci\\nShe lives alone .\\nHer son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .\\nThey live in Ohio .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .\\nHer blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .\\nNeck veins are not distended .\\nRespiratory rate 12 .\\nCarotids :\\nno bruits .\\nLungs were clear .\\nCardiac :\\n1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nPeripheral pulses intact .\\nNeurological examination non-focal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .\\nHematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .\\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .\\nThere , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .\\nHer left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .\\nShe had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .\\nHer native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .\\nThe saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .\\nThe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\\nIn addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\\nHer left internal mammary artery was also unused .\\nIt was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\\nThis was intermittent .\\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and

COURSE :\\n1 ) Cardiovascular :\\nThe patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .\\nShe remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .\\nThe patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .\\nThe patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .\\nThe patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .\\nThe patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .\\nAt this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .\\n2 ) Neurological / vascular :\\nThe discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .\\nThe patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .\\nThe left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .\\nThe patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .\\nMRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .\\nThe patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .\\nThe patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .\\nThe results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .\\nA Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .\\n3 ) Orthopedic :\\nThe patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .\\nOutside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .\\nRepeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .\\nAn Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .\\nA bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .\\nAt the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .\\nPlans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .\\n4 ) Gastrointestinal :\\nThe patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .\\nThe patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .\\nThe patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .\\nHowever , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .\\nThe patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .\\nThe etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .\\nThe patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .\\nAn attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .\\n5 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .\\nUrinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .\\nThe patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .\\nThe urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .\\n6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\\nThe patient

Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .\\nOn transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is divorced and retired .\\nShe lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is intubated .\\nVITAL SIGNS :\\nTemperature 98.6 , 66 .\\nRight arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .\\nTidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .\\nGENERAL :\\nShe was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .\\nNECK :\\nEdematous .\\nTrachea was midline .\\nShe had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .\\nThe superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .\\nShe had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .\\nHer anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .\\nLUNGS :\\nShe had bilateral expiratory wheezes .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with good bowel sounds .\\nIt was nontender .\\nIt was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .\\nBoth were easily reducible .\\nPULSE :\\nOn the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nCBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\\nCoags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .\\nHer gas was 7.47/40/332 .\\nElectrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\\nCT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\\nIt was consistent with a hematoma .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMs. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\\nThis showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\\nShe was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\\nThe differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\\nOn 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\\nA biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\\nThe operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\\nThere was no active bleeding at the time .\\nOver the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\\nShe had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\\nThe ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\\nGiven these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\\nThe Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\\nAt this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\\nDr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\\nShe underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\\nShe tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\\nHer postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\\nThis required a chest tube .\\nHer hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\\nIt was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\\nHowever , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\\nShe underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\\nIt turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\\nIn conclusion , by systems :\\n1. Neuro .\\nThe patient became intermittently agitated .\\nWe have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\\nShe responds well to this .\\nShe speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\\nShe has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\\nShe has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\\n2. Cardiac .\\nThe patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\\nThis is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\\n3. Respiratory .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\\nHer right lung field is clear .\\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\\n4. GI .\\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\\nThis is her goal .\\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\\nThese have all been negative .\\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\\n5. GU .\\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\\n6. Heme .\\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\\nShe had no problems with this .\\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\\n7. ID .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\\n8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\\nThe patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\\nHer central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nAlbuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .\\nCONDITION :\\nStable , with active problems being respiratory failure , urinary tract infection , and bleeding diathesis .\\nDISCHARGE LABS :\\nOn the day of discharge , sodium 145 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 109 , bicarb 31 , creatinine 0.7 , BUN 43 , glucose 116 .\\nCBC 14.9 , 29.2 ( which is stable ) , and 398 .\\nPT 12 , PTT 27 , and INR 1.0 .\\nMagnesium of 1.9 .\\nCalcium 8.1 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nNone .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is being discharged to an acute rehab facility .\\nShe should follow-up with Dr. Ryna Jescdrig as well as Dr. Lenni Lung in the Vascular Surgery Department in approximately three to four weeks .\\nPlease call the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Verg Medical Center for any further details that may be needed .\\nYou can also page Sta Lung , M.D. as I am the dictating physician who has been taking care of Ms. Shuffa for quite some time now .\\nI would be happy to answer any questions .\\nMy pager number at Verg Medical Center is number 54930 .\\nDictated By :\\nSTA LUNG , M.D. HU53\\nAttending :\\nRYNA R.

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nRiie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \" .\\nThis patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\\nIn the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\\nIn early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\\nIn 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\\nIn early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\\nCT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\\nIn April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\\nThereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\\nMost recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\\nThat hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\\nHe was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\\nIt was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\\nFinally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .\\nMr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .\\nAs well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to \" kidney pain \" .\\nHe was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .\\nMr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .\\nHe denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as

Medical Center .\\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .\\n2. Hypertension .\\n3. Status post hernia repair .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\\n2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .\\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\\n4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .\\n5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .\\nHead , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :\\nnegative .\\nNeck was supple .\\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\\n2+ carotids without bruits .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .\\nExtremities :\\nthe patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .\\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\\nSodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .\\nThe patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\\nThe graft used was a homograft .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nGood .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nDiet :\\nHigh calorie , high protein .\\nThe patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .\\nThe patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\\nThe

PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nOn May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .\\nShe was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .\\nOn May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .\\nHer oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .\\nChest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .\\nA VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .\\nOn May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .\\nAt this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nShe was started on a steroid trial at that point .\\nHer pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .\\nOn June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .\\nThe patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .\\nFrom May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .\\nOn June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .\\n2 ) Hypertension .\\n3 ) Status post hysterectomy .\\n4 ) Status post appendectomy .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\n1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n2 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .\\n4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.\\n5 ) Thiamine .\\n6 ) Lasix p.r.n.\\n7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.\\n8 ) Folic acid .\\n9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .\\n10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .\\n11 ) Insulin sliding scale .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient had no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is divorced .\\nShe has two children .\\nShe recently retired as a clerical worker .\\nShe denies any tobacco .\\nShe has only social alcohol use .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nFather died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .\\nMother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .\\nBrother has coronary artery disease .\\nThere is no family history of hematologic problems .\\nLABORATORY :\\nLaboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :\\nThe video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\\nThe patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .\\nThis was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\\nBy discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\\nThe patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\\nRepeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\\nAt the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\\n2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\\nThe patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .\\nShe was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .\\nHer platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .\\nHer LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .\\nShe continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .\\nThe patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .\\nEventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .\\nAfter this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .\\nIt is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .\\nShe will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .\\n3 ) Renal :\\nThe patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .\\nThroughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\\nThe opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\\nShe required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\\nDuring the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .\\n4 ) Infectious disease :\\nThe patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .\\nThe patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .\\nShe received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .\\nIn addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .\\nShe also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .\\nShe was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .\\nThe patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .\\n5 ) Rheumatology :\\nThe patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\\nUnfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .\\nA repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\n1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .\\n2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .\\nThe nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .\\n3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .\\n4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .\\nThe left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .\\nShe would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .\\n5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .\\n6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .\\n7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in

DATE :\\n2/15/94\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n2/28/94\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .\\nApparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .\\nHe came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .\\nHe had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .\\nHe became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .\\nOther medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .\\nHe also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHe was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .\\nHe had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .\\nThere were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .\\nHe had no cardiac murmur .\\nHis abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .\\nThe neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nIncluded a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .\\nThere were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .\\nThe platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .\\nHis prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .\\nHis uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .\\nThere was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .\\nAn electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .\\nHe did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .\\nHe also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .\\nHis headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .\\nThere was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .\\nTransfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .\\nAmicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .\\nA bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .\\nHe was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .\\nThe renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .\\nThe family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .\\nHe was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .\\nThey agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .\\nNo autopsy was obtained .\\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\\nTR :\\nlj / bmot\\nDD :\\n3/12/94\\nTD :\\n03/13/94\\nCC :\\nDr. Ca Shuff , FIH Oregon Dr. Ille Kote\\n[ report_end ]\\n\"),\n",

:\\n4/4/93\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\ncongestive heart failure .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\naortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .\\nALLERGIES :\\nSulfonamides .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\ncardiac catheterization - 4/1/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram 3/27/93 .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nLasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in March , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .\\nHe had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .\\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .\\nHe also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .\\nDespite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .\\nPostoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .\\nOver these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .\\nHe returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nWeight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .\\nThe venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .\\nThe carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .\\nThere was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .\\nThe right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .\\nThere was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .\\nThe liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .\\nHis chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .\\nThe electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to June , 1992 .\\nLater , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .\\nThe left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .\\nThe aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .\\nThere was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .\\nThe left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .\\nThere was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .\\nA Persantine Thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\npotassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .\\nThis was of uncertain significance .\\nThe hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .\\nOver the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .\\nCoincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .\\nGiven the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .\\nAt the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .\\nThere was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .\\nLeft ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .\\nThere was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .\\nThe anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .\\nThe aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .\\nA dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .\\nA large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .\\nThe posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .\\nThe left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .\\nThe saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .\\nCertainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .\\nThese findings were reviewed with Dr. Patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. Breun 's management .\\nHis advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .\\nPercutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .\\nIt is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. Breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .\\nHe seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .\\nHe is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .\\nWe will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. Wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .\\nETHELAN KOTEFYFECHIRD , M.D.\\nTR :\\ngo /

mucin producing ) .\\nThis prompted further staging work-up .\\nThe patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .\\nThe poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .\\nThere was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .\\nThe patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .\\nA specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .\\nThe patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .\\nOver the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .\\nShe has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .\\nShe denied fevers , chills or sweats .\\nThere has been no GI or GU symptoms except for constipation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nUnremarkable .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn admission included Percocet for pain and multivitamins .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nThe patient 's father died at age 69 with metastatic prostate cancer .\\nThe patient 's sister has a history of cervical cancer .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is married and lives with her husband .\\nShe has no children .\\nShe is a nonsmoker .\\nShe drinks socially .\\nShe has not had any alcoholic beverages during this pregnancy .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission revealed a pleasant , comfortable , tired appearing female .\\nThe patient was afebrile .\\nBlood pressure was 98/64 .\\nPulse 82 .\\nRespiratory rate 20 .\\nSkin exam revealed a right posterior parietal scalp nodle measuring 2 x 3 cm which was very firm .\\nThere was a 1 cm firm nodule at the left upper thoracic region of the back between the midline and the scapula .\\nThere was a 1 cm firm nodule in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen .\\nHEENT exam was unremarkable .\\nNeck was supple .\\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\\nThere was no lymphadenopathy .\\nBack was without CVA tenderness .\\nThere was no scapular tenderness .\\nThere was mild lower thoracic tenderness .\\nLungs were clear to auscultation .\\nThere were no rales or wheezes .\\nThere was no egophony .\\nCardiac exam was tachycardic and regular , normal S1 and S2 .\\nThere was a II / VI systolic ejection murmur loudest at the left upper sternal border .\\nThere was no heave .\\nAbdomen was gravid .\\nBowel sounds were present .\\nThe abdomen was tympanitic and nontender .\\nThe liver was 11 cm by percussion .\\nThere was no liver edge palpable , no spleen tip palpable .\\nRectal revealed normal muscle tone , heme negative stool .\\nExtremities revealed 1+ bipedal edema on admission .\\nNeurological examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented times three .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were intact .\\nMotor was 5/5 .\\nSensation was intact to light touch .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were 1-2+ and symmetric bilaterally .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission included an ALT of 108 , AST of 286 .\\nTotal bilirubin 3.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 .\\nAlkaline phosphatase 1148 .\\nLDH 806 .\\nCalcium 11.8 .\\nAlbumin 2.3 .\\nHematocrit was 30.6 .\\nWhite blood cell count was 11.14 .\\nPT was 13.2 .\\nPTT was 29.8 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .\\nThe work-up for the extent of the patient 's disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .\\nAn epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .\\nAn abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ;

:\\n02/18/1991\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .\\n2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .\\n3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\\nHe was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\\nHe was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\\nHe initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\\nAt discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\\nHe was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\\nOn 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .\\nHe was evaluated in the Emergency Room .\\nAt that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\\n2) Recent PCP .\\n3) Status post right elbow surgery .\\n4) Venereal disease history .\\n5) PPD anergic .\\nThe patient 's HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .\\nSKIN :\\nJaundiced .\\nHEENT :\\nRevealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .\\nNECK :\\nHe had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .\\nLUNGS :\\nHad tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .\\nCARDIAC :\\nShowed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .\\nHis liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .\\nHis spleen was not palpable .\\nRECTAL :\\nHe had guaiac positive stools .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nUnremarkable .\\nGENITOURINARY :\\nHis penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .\\nNEUROLOGICAL :\\nNon-focal .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .\\nPT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .\\nSodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .\\nALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\\n( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\\nHis arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\\nHis chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\\nThe patient 's abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\\nThe patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve .\\nThe patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical status deteriorated .\\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\\nHowever , the patient 's respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient died in hospital .\\nAn autopsy will be performed .\\nAn autopsy was performed as per the family 's wishes .\\nWE221/9850 TAKO C.

PROBABLY DURATION :\\nThe patient is disabled .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMs. Kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from Daleglo Medical Center with renal insufficiency .\\nThe patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the Daleglo Medical Center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .\\nShe was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .\\nThe patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\\nShe was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .\\nShe was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHer past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in April of 1997 .\\nShe also has a history of urinary tract infection .\\nShe has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .\\nIn 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .\\nThere was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .\\nThe patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .\\nShe also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .\\nShe also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .\\nOn arrival to the Ph University Of Medical Center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .\\nHowever , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination her pulse was 55 .\\nHer systolic blood pressure was 110 .\\nShe appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .\\nHer lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .\\nHer cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .\\nHer abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nLaboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .\\nBUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .\\nA chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .\\nA KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .\\nAn electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .\\nA urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .\\nA head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .\\nThere was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .\\nThe patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .\\nAt that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .\\nThe recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .\\nOn the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .\\nShe was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .\\nHowever , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .\\nHer eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .\\nThe patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .\\nA cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .\\nThere was trace mitral regurgitation .\\nMultiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .\\nThere was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .\\nThe patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .\\nShe was also continued to be hydrated .\\nHer blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .\\nAfter careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .\\nThe patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .\\nHer BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .\\nDigoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .\\nThe patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .\\nHer ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .\\nIt was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .\\nHowever , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .\\nNevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .\\nMajor consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .\\nInitially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .\\nHowever , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .\\nI discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .\\nNevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .\\nThe patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .\\nI will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .\\nMy direct pager is 935-131-3314 .\\nTAMYRCLEO KOTE , M.D.\\nTR :\\ngqx\\nDD :\\n07/27/1999\\nTD :\\n07/27/1999 7:52 P\\ncc :\\nTAMYRCLEO NADON KOTE , M.D. RYNVI

December of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .\\nCystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .\\nA CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .\\nA biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .\\nBetween March and May of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .\\nIn June of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in July of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .\\nHer chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .\\nAlso in July of l99l , she had right hip pain .\\nThere was a bony metastasis .\\nOrthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal

right shoulder and femur .\\nPlain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .\\nThe Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .\\nPlanning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .\\nShe was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .\\nShe was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .\\nThe patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .\\nDue to Dr.

The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\\nA swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\\nSeveral NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\\nThe patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\\nHe was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .\\nOther options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\\nThe family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .\\nIt is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .\\n4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\\nThe patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\\nThe chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\\nHowever , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\\nThe patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\\nNo organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\\n5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\\nIt was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\\nHe had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\\nThe patient continued to be asymptomatic .\\n6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\\nThe patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\\nThese issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\\nPsychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\\n7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .\\nIt was decided the patient 's code status would not be DNR , DNI .\\n8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .\\nHe underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .\\nLaboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .\\nCBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .\\nThe white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .\\nThe last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .\\nThe last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .\\nThe patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .\\nA faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .\\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURES :\\nExtraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\n1) Aspiration pneumonia .\\n2) GI bleed .\\n3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient is stable on discharge .\\nThe patient is to be transferred to Paw.ryfear Medical Center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nPepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

however , no ischemia was seen .\\nAn echocardiogram was done .\\nThe echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .\\nThe right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .\\nThe percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .\\nThe fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .\\nOn 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .\\nHis white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .\\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .\\nApproximately 100 cc.\\'s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .\\nThe computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .\\nBecause of the patient \\'s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .\\nAn exploratory laparotomy was performed .\\nThe splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .\\nThus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .\\nThe patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .\\nDrainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nIn the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .\\nThe patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .\\nHe remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .\\nThereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .\\nHe was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .\\nHe had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .\\nThese resolved without incident .\\nHe also had repeated temperature spikes .\\nAfter repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .\\nHis drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .\\nMr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .\\nMost recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .\\nThis 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .\\nThe patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .\\nThe patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .\\nHe was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .\\nMr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .\\nHe remained stable from a cardiac fashion .\\nHe did have problems with po intake .\\nHe had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .\\nHe was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .\\nHe remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .\\nBy the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .\\nThe patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .\\nMultiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient \\'s wife , with this same result .\\nAfter discussion with the patient \\'s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .\\nOf note , given the patient \\'s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient \\'s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\nMEDICATIONS :\\n1.

96 .\\nOtherwise , the SMA 20 was within normal limits .\\nWhite count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .\\nPlatelet count was 350,000 .\\nDifferential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil .\\nPT was l3.l and PTT was 30.9 .\\nUrinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .\\nChest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .\\nEKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .\\nNo old EKG was available for comparison .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\n1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .\\nCell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .\\nPatient also had an MRI

normal limits .\\nThe patient underwent Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .\\nShe tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .\\nThis was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .\\nShe received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .\\n2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .\\nShe had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .\\nWork-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .\\nHaptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .\\nGlucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .\\nThis was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .\\nPatient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .\\nA clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .\\nShe did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .\\nPatient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the September , the September , the September , and the Septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers .\\n3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.\\nSubsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .\\nPatient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .\\nHer Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nMultivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , Halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and Acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nDisposition is to home .\\nFollow-up care will be per Dr. Critche at the Cockdownbayscot Waredoun Inmountsonente Memorial and per Dr. A Or at the Retelk County Medical Center with regard to the Rys Memorial Hospital protocol .\\n________________________________\\nMJ092/0660 A L.

:\\nurinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson 's disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient presented to Ph University Of Medical Center with a fever .\\nThe patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .\\nHe reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days .\\nOf note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson 's disease .\\nHis wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .\\nThey went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for admission .\\nHe was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .\\nHe has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nMEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe had no known drug allergies .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .\\nThere was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .\\nHe was continued on his Parkinson 's medications .\\nA head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .\\nHead CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .\\nDr. Factor agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .\\nHe was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .\\nHe was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .\\nThe patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full Arnsperni Health services .\\nBedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .\\nHe did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .\\nThus , he was considered ready for discharge .\\nHe again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .\\nHe again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .\\nHe was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .\\nOn 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .\\nBrachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .\\nHe was hypotensive into the 80s .\\nAn electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .\\nRV leads were negative for ST elevation .\\nA chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .\\nA portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .\\nAnterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .\\nHe had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThe right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .\\nThe patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .\\nHe was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .\\nHe was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .\\nHe was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .\\nHe surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .\\nHe was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .\\nThe patient continued fairly stable while intubated .\\nTwo days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .\\nHe had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .\\nHis neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .\\nDiscussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .\\nThey were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .\\nAn echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .\\nThey did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .\\nThe repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .\\nThe lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .\\nDiscussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .\\nHe was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .\\nThe patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .\\nNo further blood draws were done .\\nThe patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .\\nComfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where Mr. Koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations .\\nHe was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 .\\nThe family and the attending physician were

:\\n07/27/1996\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMs. Rule is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke 's C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on 7/8/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .\\nShe first presented in April of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke 's B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .\\nShe then represented in March of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .\\nShe underwent a sigmoid resection on 5/17/96 by Dr. Lenni Pain .\\nAt the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .\\nPathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .\\nOne of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .\\nShe was therefore staged Dukes C2 .\\nAn abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .\\nA chest x-ray was read as clear .\\nShe is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .\\nShe presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on 6/5/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .\\nShe began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .\\nShe was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. Aacent Slentjae of the Linatpromehack Worth Hospital for Radiation Therapy .\\nShe began treatment on 6/20/96 .\\nShe subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on June 25th , 26th and 27th of 1996 , which she tolerated well .\\nHer course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of June .\\nShe had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .\\nAn MRI was performed on 6/25/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .\\nHowever , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .\\nShe presented to the Retelk County Medical Center Emergency Room on 7/8/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .\\nShe denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.\\n(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .\\nCardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .\\nAn echocardiogram in June of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .\\nHer baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .\\n(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\\n(4) Osteoporosis .\\n(5) Hypercholesterolemia .\\n(6) History of herpes zoster .\\n(7) Status post appendectomy .\\n(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. Lenni Pain .\\nHer abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .\\nA KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .\\nAn abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .\\nHowever , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .\\nThis was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .\\nThese findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .\\nShe was admitted and made NPO .\\nOn admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .\\nShe was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .\\nHer ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .\\nShe was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .\\nShe was also placed on neutropenic precautions .\\nShe continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .\\nHowever , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .\\nHowever , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .\\nBy 7/15/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .\\nBy 7/18/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .\\nShe was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .\\nOf note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .\\nOf note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .\\nShe was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nWe recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .\\nDuring this time she will continue to receive TPN .\\nAfter that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .\\nHer small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nInsulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .\\nMake sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .\\nIn addition to the above , she has the following additives :\\n20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .\\nTherefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .\\nMs. Rule is to follow-up with Dr. Chelkjescchalsere , who can be reached at 148-701-5440 .\\nDictated By :\\nSHASQUALENA R.

however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .\\nThe patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .\\nA Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .\\nSubsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .\\nBlood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .\\nThe patient 's fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .\\nThe patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .\\nGradually over the course of the following days , the patient 's electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.' s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .\\nOn hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .\\nThe patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .\\nShould the patient 's p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .\\nIf the patient 's p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .\\nThe Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .\\nPeriodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .\\nIt should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .\\nThe patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .\\nThe Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient 's urinary obstruction will be addressed .\\nDictated By :\\nCHIEROBEBREUTZ , M.D. AA578/3804 CONRELLIE S.

was supple with no thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nThe heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .\\nIt radiates to both carotids bilaterally .\\nThere was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient 's apex to axilla .\\nThere was no S3 appreciated .\\nVascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs .\\nAbdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , no organomegaly , no masses , normal active bowel sounds .\\nThe patient 's extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base .\\nNeurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .\\nShe was arousable only to painful stimuli .\\nHer pupils were reactive bilaterally .\\nHer face was symmetric .\\nShe had an intact gag reflex .\\nShe was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .\\nHer deep tendon reflexes were slightly diminished at 1+ bilaterally , but symmetric .\\nLABORATORY :\\nThe patient 's laboratory data on admission is as follows :\\nSodium was 142 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 99 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 .\\nAST was 25 , alkaline phosphatase 130 ,

the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .\\nA neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .\\nThe Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .\\nThe patient 's mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .\\nA neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .\\nThe patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's mental status is back to its baseline .\\n2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :\\nThe patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .\\nThe patient 's antibiotics were discontinued with the thought that prolonged

History of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy 03/2004 .\\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :\\nRadiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nOne of several PUOMC admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .\\nShe had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .\\nNot long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .\\nShe ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .\\nShe had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .\\nThere had been no focal neurologic changes .\\nUp until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .\\nOn admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .\\nShe did look mildly dyspneic .\\nHer lungs were clear .\\nShe had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .\\nShe was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .\\nThe rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .\\nBilirubin normal .\\nHer ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .\\nHer alk phos slightly up at 174 .\\nWBC 10.8 with normal differential .\\nHemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .\\nA urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .\\nA CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .\\nThe patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .\\nShe gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .\\nThis was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .\\nShe also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .\\nShe had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .\\nA single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .\\nHer bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .\\nThe sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .\\nPLAN :\\nEscalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .\\nShe lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .\\nThe patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .\\nShe was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. First 's office to have further discussions of this later approach .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nZofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .\\nDoculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n.

:\\n06/22/1991\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nMETASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .\\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .\\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :\\nEchocardiogram times two .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nPatient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .\\nPatient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .\\nPathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .\\nPatient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .\\nOn ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .\\nShe underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\\nPathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .\\nThe patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .\\nShe was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .\\nShe was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .\\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .\\nEKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .\\nGiven the patient 's history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .\\nShe was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nAs above .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\n02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS :\\nPrednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nEmaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .\\nTemperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .\\nHEENT :\\nDry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .\\nNECK :\\nNo lymphadenopathy .\\nCHEST :\\nFew inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .\\nHEART :\\nRegular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .\\nABDOMEN :\\nWell healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .\\nPELVIC :\\nNo masses .\\nRECTAL :\\nNo masses and guaiac negative .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nNo edema or cyanosis .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nHematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .\\nPT and PTT were 12 and 26 .\\nElectrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .\\nThere was no evidence of tamponade .\\nAn echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .\\nEchocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .\\nCardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .\\nShe continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .\\nHer steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .\\nThey felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .\\nShe had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .\\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .\\nShe was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .\\nCardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .\\nEKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .\\nShe should have a follow-up echocardiogram .\\nEchocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .\\nThoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .\\nShe should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .\\nShe underwent her CT scan .\\nThis showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .\\nPulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .\\nChemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .\\nShe also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .\\nShe was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .\\nDermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .\\nThey therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .\\nThe patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .\\nHer cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .\\nCardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .\\nThey therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .\\nShe had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .\\nThe Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .\\nShe had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .\\nPsychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .\\nShe was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .\\nShe continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nShe will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nPremarin 0.625 q.d. ,

deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .\\nHis family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson \\'s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .\\nThis was poorly responsive to Eldopa .\\nHe was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .\\nOver the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .\\nHe also developed a urinary incontinence .\\nHe had had two falls to his wife \\'s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .\\nOn the morning of admission at 8 o\\'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking \" gibberish \" .\\nHe was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.\\nThere was no definite clonic activity .\\nThere was no known incontinence .\\nHe was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .\\nA trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nCoumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .\\nALLERGIES :\\nno known drug allergies .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,\\n2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .\\n3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .\\n4) old right frontal infarct .\\n5) hypertension .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .\\nHe is a former professor at Montana .\\nTobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .\\nAlcohol ; he has no recent use .\\nHe was a previous drinker of one \" old fashioned \" every night .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nHe has a father who had dementia .\\nThere was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nvital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .\\nHe was afebrile .\\nIn general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .\\nhead , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .\\nHis neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .\\noropharynx was intubated with blood as well .\\nLungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nAbdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .\\nNeurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .\\nHe does not regard the examiner .\\nHe had no blink to threat .\\nHis pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .\\nAccording to the family this iansicoria was old .\\nHe had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .\\nHe had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .\\nHe had no gag to tube manipulation .\\nMotor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .\\nHe triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .\\nHis deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .\\nHis toes were down going .\\nSUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :\\nsodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .\\nchest x-ray clear .\\nelectrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .\\nHead CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .\\nThere was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\n1) NEUROLOGY :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\\nHe had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .\\nIt did , however , show diffuse slowing .\\nHe was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .\\nHis hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .\\nHe did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\\nHis diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .\\nIt was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\\nIt was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson \\'s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\\nHe had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .\\nThis showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .\\nIn addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .\\nHowever , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .\\nThe etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nHis electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .\\nHe was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .\\nHe did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\\nThat was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" .\\nHe remained chest pain free throughout his admission .\\n3) PULMONARY :\\nAfter his initial intubation he remained quite stable .\\nHe was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .\\nHowever , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .\\n4) HEMATOLOGY :\\nHe had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\\nHis anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\\nIt was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\\nHe did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .\\nIt was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .\\n5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\\nHe was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .\\nThus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .\\nIn discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .\\nHowever , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .\\nThe family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable .\\nDOCTOR \\'S DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nThe patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .\\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nDilantin 100 mgs po tid , Carafate 1 gram po qid , Digoxin 0.25 mgs po qd , Isordil 20 mgs po tid , Captopril 25 mgs po tid , Lopressor 50 mgs po bid , Colace 100 mgs

a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .\\nAn initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in August , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .\\nIn September , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .\\nHe was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nA follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .\\nHe was treated with aspirin .\\nNovember 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .\\nPostoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .\\nHe was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on December 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .\\nNow preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .\\nHe is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nStatus post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .\\nDIET :\\nJevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nAspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nDenies use of alcohol and tobacco .\\nHe is married and lives in Nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nVital signs :\\nHeart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .\\nGeneral :\\nThis is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .\\nHEENT ,

extremities .\\nDeep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .\\nCerebella intact .\\nGait steady .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThis 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .\\nPostoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\\nHe was extubated on postoperative day number one .\\nHis neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\\nHe was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\\nHe was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\\nHe noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nOn postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\\nHe vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\\nA head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\\nA lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\\nA culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\\nHe was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\\nHe was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\\nA video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\\nBecause of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\\nHe underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\\nPrior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\\nAfter conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\\nIt was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\\nHis visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\\nHis lumbar drain was removed after five days .\\nHe was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nHe is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .\\n2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.\\nHe will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nFollow-up will be with Dr. Sick in one weeks time .\\nHe will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .\\nADDENDUM\\nMr. Marker will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\\n9. Hypercoagulable state .\\n10. Perforated viscus .\\n11. Abdominal abscesses .\\n12. Sepsis .\\n13. Respiratory failure .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .\\nThese culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .\\nThis required a transplant nephrectomy .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient 's course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .\\nHe was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .\\nOn transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .\\nThe patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .\\nA pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .\\nAn inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .\\nThe patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .\\nThe patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .\\nThe physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .\\nCT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .\\nFor the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .\\nThe patient remained unstable .\\nHe was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .\\nFor this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .\\nThe patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .\\nAccompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .\\nThe patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .\\nThere was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .\\nHe was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .\\nThe patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .\\nBecause of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .\\nAttention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .\\nNonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .\\nHe remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .\\nHis course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .\\nHe had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .\\nThe patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .\\nBloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .\\nExtensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .\\nIt was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .\\nDr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .\\nAll physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .\\nThis was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .\\nI L.

Ecotrin , 325 mg QD ; Coumadin , 2.5 mg PO QD ; Lisinopril , 2.5 mg PO QD ; Micronase , 5 mg PO BID .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .\\nHe also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .\\nHe had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .\\nA CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .\\nHe was started on aspirin .\\nHe has a family history of hypertension as well .\\nHe was also placed on Vasotec .\\nA Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .\\nA thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .\\nAn echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .\\nAccordingly he was referred for further evaluation .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nBlood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb .\\nHead , neck :\\nunremarkable .\\nLungs clear .\\nCarotids normal .\\nCardiac :\\nLoud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .\\nAbdomen was benign .\\nPeripheral pulses intact .\\nNeurological :\\nNonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .\\nCholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .\\nHematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .\\nMCV was 85 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .\\nThis lowered with IV nitroglycerin .\\nSelective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .\\nHe had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .\\nHis left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .\\nThe situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .\\nShe noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .\\nIt was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .\\nIndeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .\\nHe stabilized over the weekend .\\nHe was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .\\nHe developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .\\nHe also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .\\nHe had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .\\nTherefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .\\nOn 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nHe had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .\\nA paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\\nAfter surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .\\nHe was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .\\nHe had good hemodynamics .\\nHe had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .\\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\\nHe was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .\\nOn 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .\\nTherefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .\\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm .\\nHe did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .\\nHe had a right bundle branch block .\\nHe is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .\\nTherefore he was able to be discharged home .\\nHe understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .\\nACHASTHA N.

CERVICAL POLYPS\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nThe patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 .\\nShe was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .\\nPatient also received AICD .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .\\nPatient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :\\nIn 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware .\\nSince that time the patient has been treated medically .\\nIn 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .\\nOn 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center .\\nEchocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .\\nConsequently the patient was started on Coumadin .\\nCatheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .\\nCoronaries were completely normal .\\nConsequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .\\nIn the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .\\nHemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .\\nPulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .\\nRepeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .\\nFurthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .\\nConsequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .\\nThe patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .\\nAt that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .\\nBy report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .\\nDring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .\\nShe was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .\\nShe was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .\\nShe was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation .\\nThe patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .\\nThe patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .\\nIt was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .\\nFurthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .\\nNote , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .\\nOn 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed .\\nThe patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .\\nConsequently AICD placement was recommended .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .\\nNote , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .\\nNote , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .\\nCultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .\\nThus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .\\nThere were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .\\nBy 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .\\nAt this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .\\nIt was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself .\\nThis was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nType II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNKDA .\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\\nCaptopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg q.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , Xanax .25 mg prn , Beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil 2 puffs

alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol .\\nThe patient lives with her daughter and is unable to work .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nPositive for lung cancer and positive for hypertension .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nHEENT :\\nWithin normal limits .\\nNECK :\\nSupple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits .\\nJugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy .\\nCARDIOVASCULAR :\\nRegular rate and rhythm , II / VI systolic murmur , negative for L3 .\\nNote that the S2 was greater than S1 .\\nLUNGS

placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .\\nAs per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .\\nAn EPS study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus .\\nConsequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .\\nHospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement .\\nNote , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology .\\nCultures were negative .\\nDebridement was negative for purulent discharge .\\nPathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection .\\nThe patient did well following the AICD placement .\\nThere were no intraoperative complications , and no postoperative complications .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient is discharged to home in stable condition on 03/13/94 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 20 mEq

sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .\\nIn December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .\\nHe was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .\\nHe underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. Slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .\\nHe was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .\\nOn 9/2/98 he was admitted to Cay Memorial Hospital Of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .\\nHe had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .\\nAn echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .\\nHe was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .\\nHe was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .\\nHe denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\\nHe continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further evaluation and management .\\nPrior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nHypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nSotalol 160 mg bid .\\nAtenolol 25 mg bid .\\nPrilosec 20 mg qd .\\nPropulsid 10 mg qd .\\nNPH and CZI insulin .\\nResulin 400 mg qd .\\nLisinopril 10 mg bid .\\nAspirin .\\nLasix 60 mg qd .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .\\nThere was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .\\nHowever , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .\\nPHYSICAL EXAM :\\nHe was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .\\nHis lungs were clear throughout .\\nHis apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .\\nThere was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .\\nCarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .\\nHis abdomen was benign .\\nFemoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nBUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .\\nHis creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .\\nHis hematocrit was 49.3 .\\nHis electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .\\nThere were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\\nGiven his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\\nHis initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .\\nHe was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\\nAccordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\\nHis right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\\nHe had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\\nHis left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\\nThe patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\\nThere was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\\nMapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\\nRadiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\\nThere were no complications .\\nFollowing the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\\nHe still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\\nIn following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\\nThere were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\\nHe also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\\nFollowing the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\\nHis Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\\nAfter the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\\nHis INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .\\nFinally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .\\nAccordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\\nHe did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\\nFinally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .\\nGiven his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nHe was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .\\nHe will have a visiting nurse to see him on Iat .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nHe will follow-up with Dr. Taarnna Service at Ph University Of Medical Center as well as Dr. Lupevickette Folk and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach on Villean Garl .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nAtenolol 25 mg bid .\\nSotalol 120 mg bid .\\nLasix 60 mg qd .\\nEcotrin 1 qd ( on hold until off of Coumadin ) .\\nCoumadin 5 mg qhs or as directed for four weeks

treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .\\nPatient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .\\nID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .\\nSubsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .\\nPatient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing

white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPatient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .\\nWorkup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .\\nBlood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .\\nA repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .\\nA repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .\\nIn the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .\\nInfectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .\\nPentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .\\nClinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .\\nIdiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .\\nHowever , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .\\nMost likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\\nA single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .\\nPatient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .\\nOn November 30 , a family meeting with patient \\'s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient \\'s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\\nDecision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient \\'s comfort .\\nPentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient \\'s comfort .\\nDNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .\\nThe patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .\\nTylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .\\nSuch measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .\\nThis interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course .\\nDictated By :\\nSHAA KACHOLERA STONGE ,

:\\n04/09/1991\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\\nEPIGLOTTITIS .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .\\nOf note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .\\nShe was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .\\nShe did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.\\nShe denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .\\nShe was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .\\nHe recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .\\nExamination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .\\nThere was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .\\nApparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to Ez Ephtro Health Center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .\\nThe patient 's granddaughter , however , works at Retelk County Medical Center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to Retelk County Medical Center .\\nShe presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .\\nShe was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .\\nShe did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .\\nShe was febrile to 101.7 .\\nENT consult was obtained .\\nA lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .\\nENT examination was then to be performed .\\nChest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :\\nNone .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNone .\\nSmoking none .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNegative .\\nAlcohol none .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nLives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .\\nShe had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .\\nHer ear examination was normal .\\nNasal examination was normal .\\nOral cavity was normal .\\nNeck :\\nRevealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .\\nNeck :\\nOtherwise normal and the trachea was midline .\\nHypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .\\nThe left pyriform was obliterated by edema .\\nThe right pyriform was narrowed by edema .\\nThe epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .\\nThe patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .\\nThere was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .\\nLungs :\\nClear .\\nHeart :\\nRegular rate and rhythm .\\nS1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .\\nAbdomen :\\nSoft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .\\nNo masses .\\nExtremities :\\nNormal .\\nBack :\\nShowed significant thoracic kiphosis .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nRevealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .\\nAs noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .\\nThe chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .\\nShe was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .\\nDue to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .\\nShe was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .\\nThe patient was sedated .\\nDirect laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .\\nShe was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .\\nHer initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .\\nAt the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .\\nHer episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .\\nShe had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .\\nShe was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .\\nEKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .\\nShe continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .\\nHer blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .\\nShe was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .\\nShe went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .\\nShe continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .\\nHer edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .\\nOn 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .\\nShe was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .\\nExamination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .\\nOtherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .\\nOf note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .\\nOnce the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .\\nTube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .\\nAfter extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .\\nAgain , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .\\nO2 saturations looked good .\\nIt was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .\\nShe was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .\\nShe was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .\\nHer white counts came down .\\nBlood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .\\nShe had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .\\nCardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .\\nUnfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .\\nNonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .\\nHer mental status began to clear under the family 's request .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nOn 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .\\nOur plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .\\nShe , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .\\nIf she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .\\nDischarge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .\\nThe patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\nEPIGLOTTITIS , QUESTION SECONDARY TO EPIGLOTTIC MALIGNANCY .\\nRG556/4903 EENTO WORKS , M.D. NL6\\nD :\\n04/10/91\\nBatch :\\n5391\\nReport :\\nU5989C79\\nT :\\n04/10/91\\nDicatated By :\\nSA JESCWIERST , M.D.\\n[ report_end ]\\n\"),\n",

postoperatively .\\nThe patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .\\nThe patient remained intubated postoperatively .\\nShe had a

addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .\\nEpidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .\\nThe patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .\\nSerum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .\\nThe patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .\\nShe was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .\\nThis was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .\\nNeurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .\\nLaboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .\\nNeurological consultation was obtained .\\nIt was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .\\nThe epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .\\nMRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .\\nThe patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .\\nShe was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .\\nContinued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .\\nHer ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .\\nSocial Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .\\nThe patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .\\nThe patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .\\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .\\nShe was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .\\nAdditional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center .\\nIt is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nIs satisfactory .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\\n(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .\\nCOMPLICATIONS :\\nDuring this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .\\nDISCHARGE

nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .\\nHe received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .\\nAfter that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .\\nThe patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .\\nHe was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .\\nBUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .\\nProstate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .\\nFurther evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .\\nBecause of the

units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .\\nAfter transfusion , the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .\\nThe patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .\\nHe continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .\\nDuring this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .\\nCPK was tracked , but was totally normal .\\nNo beta blockers were given .\\nA long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .\\nDr. Lucreamull discussed the patient 's clinical status and overall situation with the patient 's family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .\\nThe patient 's primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .\\nThe patient was discharged to home for hospice on

Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE , M.D.\\nAttending :\\nLA INEMACISTIN PRONTMANDES , M.D. HD45 SY882/1177\\nBatch :\\n020\\nIndex No.\\nYJQI3J9VU6\\nD :\\n01/25/94\\nT :\\n01/25/94\\n[ report_end ]\\n\"),\n",

NUMBER :\\n512-13-39\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n01/18/2001\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. Riode Area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .\\nThe patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .\\nHe had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .\\nHe also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .\\nHe was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .\\nThe patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. Area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .\\nHe has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .\\nHe had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nHis medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .\\nHis Coumadin has been held for two days .\\nHis claudication is equal bilaterally .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .\\nHis rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the Tocon Hospital the previous week .\\nHe has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .\\nHis pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nHis BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .\\nHe has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nDr. Area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .\\nAfter discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .\\nEP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .\\nThere was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .\\nSuperficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .\\nThere was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .\\nThe profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .\\nIt was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .\\nThe patient postoperatively did quite well .\\nHe had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .\\nHis groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .\\nBecause of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .\\nThe orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to Frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly .\\nNo cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .\\nDespite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .\\nI had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .\\nI explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .\\nDEGREG R.

PO titrated to 4 loose stools per day .\\nCardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and TNG drip , Lasix , Aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 .\\nRhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues .\\nHis PR interval was watched as propranolol was started .\\nThere was no evidence of ischemia .\\nPulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam .\\nHe was treated with inhalers .\\nThere was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray .\\nGI wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices .\\nHe was kept NPO .\\nHe was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure .\\nHe was also started on triatide , omeprazole .\\nIn terms of Hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed .\\nFor this , he was given 6 units of FFP , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets .\\nHe was also given Vitamin K 10 mg. PO x 3 days .\\nHe was treated with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis .\\nHe was kept in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued GI bleed .\\nAt that point , he was transferred to Carespistown Hospital for further management .\\nOn his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike .\\nDespite this , he was started on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD on March 18th as well as Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia .\\nThe major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis .\\nHis Aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses .\\nIn addition , Lasix was added on to help him with diuresis .\\nBetween March 20th and March 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen .\\nHowever , after Lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and Lasix was held for 24 hours .\\nAt that time , a dose of 20 mg. IV BID was re-instigated .\\nOn the 400 mg. of Aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 .\\nTherefore , on March 25th , his Aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. PO TID and Lasix was kept at 20 mg. BID .\\nOn this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable .\\nHe was also kept on a low salt diet .\\nHe was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction .\\nBy March 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center , although he would stay in the Medical Unit there before returning back to his own room .\\nAt discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center are :\\n1. Necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized .\\nAt discharge , he was on 100 mg. Aldactone TID and 20 mg. of Lasix BID but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of Lasix to Aldactone was optimized .\\n2. He also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status .\\n3. He also needs TID fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar .\\n4. In terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his Flagyl 500 mg. q8hours .\\nFor SBP prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .\\n5. He should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet .\\n6. He also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible .\\n7. He should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his GI bleeding has stabilized .\\nFOLLOW UP :\\n1. He will follow up with his primary care physician , Dr. Portal , at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center .\\nDoctor Portal has been notified of the patient \\'s progress at Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .\\n2. From our GI Service , the patient will follow up with Dr. Shufftakeaakote and follow up will be arranged in GI Clinic for next week .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1. Prilosec 20 mg. PO BID .\\n2. Zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO QD .\\n3. Isordil 10 mg. PO TID .\\n4. Lopressor 12.5 mg. PO BID .\\n5. Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .\\n6. Atrovent nebs q8hours .\\n7. Flagyl 500 mg.

NPH Insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional CZI Insulin based on TID fingersticks .\\nADDENDUM :\\nUnfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his Lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome .\\nHis potassium also climbed to 5.1 .\\nBecause of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his Lasix and Aldactone .\\nDespite holding his Aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days .\\nIt went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 .\\nHe was treated with Kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this .\\nBy 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 .\\nWe then restarted a much smaller dose of Aldactoneat 50 mg. PO Q day .\\nThis was the dose of Aldactone he had originally been admitted with .\\nOn 3/31/98 the junior resident on Drugway Hospital , Dr. Asaleysean Portal , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care .\\nPatient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness .\\nSpecifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the ACLS protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest .\\nHe also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly GI bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken .\\nSpecifically he did not want to be re-banded .\\nWe also addressed the possibility of having the GI service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding .\\nHe said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease .\\nThe patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital where he is in residence .\\nDr. Asaleysean Portal spoke with Dr. Fat of the Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nlactulose 30 cc \\'s PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg. PO b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO Q day , Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d. , Metoprolol 12.5 mg. PO b.i.d. , Levofloxacin 250 mg. PO Q day , Atrovent nebs Q8 hours , Albuterol nebs Q8 hours , and Flagyl 500 mg. IV Q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 .\\nPatient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home .\\nHe was also on Aldactone 50 mg. PO Q day .\\nWe decided to discontinue his Lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine .\\nAt the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , BUN and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of Aldactone .\\nHe should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction .\\nHe will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with Dr. Fat at Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital .\\nASALEYSEAN ILON PORTAL , M.D. , Ph.D.\\nTR :\\nimj\\nDD :\\n03/27/1998\\nTD :\\n03/26/1998 2:37\\nPcc :\\nASALEYSEAN ILON PORTAL , M.D. RI MIENGRE TLANDMAUL , M.D. STAT\\nREVISED 3/31/98\\nEdited 04/03/1998 dv\\n[ report_end ]\\n'),\n",

automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator .\\nOTHER PROCEDURES :\\n3-11-94 , right heart cardiac catheterization with comprehensive electrophysiology study and radio frequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nZestril 5 mg PO q.day , Nitropatch .2 mg once daily , Sotalol 120 mg PO b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Coumadin as directed .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .\\nHe had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .\\nHe presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in December , 1994 and was admitted to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .\\nThe coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .\\nAn echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .\\nHe had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .\\nAfter the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .\\nThe patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .\\nOn March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .\\nThe patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .\\nThe tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .\\nThe patient was transferred to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital for further evaluation .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nThe past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .\\nHis blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .\\nThe carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .\\nThe jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .\\nLung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nnormal Sl and S2 .\\nThe abdomen was benign .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .\\nThe patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .\\nIntravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .\\nOn March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .\\nDuring the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .\\nPace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .\\nAfter mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .\\nAfter radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .\\nHowever , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .\\nSince the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .\\nThe patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .\\nOn March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .\\nThen , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .\\nThe defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .\\nThe patient 's postoperative course was uneventful .\\nOn March 19 , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .\\nUnder brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .\\nThis was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .\\nThree zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .\\nFor tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .\\nFor tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .\\nFor tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .\\nVVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .\\nThe patient felt good on the morning of March 20 .\\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .\\nHe will have his prothrombin time checked on Monday and will follow up with the Defibrillator Clinic .\\nANN BREUNA , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nICECA BACK , M.D.\\nTR :\\nod /
