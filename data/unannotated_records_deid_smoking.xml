HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and placed on Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia .
He was also placed on intravenous nitroglycerin , oxygen and aspirin for his coronary ischemia .
No heparin was given because of his esophageal laceration .

He was taken for esophagogastroduodenoscopy by the Surgical Service after elective intubation for airway control .
There was large fresh clot covering the lower part of the esophagus starting at 35 cm and extending distally to the esophagogastric junction along the left curvature side of the stomach .
The clot was dense despite multiple attempts at lavage .
There was no lesion noted in the stomach .
The pylorus was entered and the first and second portion of the duodenum were inspected and were seen to be normal .
The scope was retroflexed in the antrum where it showed a normal fundus of the stomach and normal esophagogastric junction .
It was felt the patient &apos;s GI bleeding was secondary to his previously known esophageal tear .
He was readmitted to the Coronary Care Unit on the 25th , where initially he was stable .
His aspirin was discontinued .
He was continued on the intravenous Cimetidine and Carafate except that he was made NPO .
He was transfused to keep hematocrit greater than 30 .

On the 25th he developed progressive hypotension with evidence of further upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
He was intubated for airway protection .
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a right rate related right bundle and apical ST changes consistent with ischemia .
Repeat endoscopy was unsuccessful because of severe bleeding despite massive lavage .
A pneumothorax was noted on his chest X-ray on the 25th and a chest tube was placed .
On the 26th , because of continued massive bleeding , he was taken by Vascular Radiology for a question of embolization .
Three sites of active extravasation were found , one from the gastroesophageal junction area and two from the gastric fundus .
All sites were successfully embolized with Gelfoam with non-selective arterial embolization of the spleen occurring as well .
No varices were noted .
Severe right external iliac stenosis was noted .
The patient returned to the floor on the 26th with improved hemodynamics .
He was continued to be managed with packed red blood cells , platelets and fresh frozen plasma .
He was continued to be intubated with poor mental status .
He was paralyzed for the vascular procedure .
A head computerized tomography scan on the 26th showed a probable right cerebellar infarct and a question of a right middle cerebral artery infarct .
Given the multi organ system failure on the 26th the family was consulted regarding his dismal prognosis and they decided to make the patient do not resuscitate without further pressures or aggressive measures with comfort care being paramount .
The patient continued to have bleeding with progressive downward deterioration of his mental status and renal failure and temperature spikes .
The patient died on the 31st .
No cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed as per the patient and family wishes .

She was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous Saline and then Lasix .
She was also treated with Calcitonin .
During this hospitalization with hydration and diuresis , her calcium fell to normal levels and her renal function corrected to normal .
It was felt that the cause of her hypercalcemia is related to progression of metastatic breast cancer and possibly as a flare to Fareston .
The Fareston was discontinued , Lupron 7.5 mg monthly was initiated and Arimidex 1 mg PO q.d. was initiated .
She was able to tolerate these medicines quite well .
In addition , we started her on Taxol 80 mg per meter square with the first dose administered on 01/30/2000 and to be continued as an outpatient .
She complained of some pain in her left lower extremity .
Deep venous thrombosis was shown by color flow Doppler and she was started on Fragmin and Coumadin during this hospitalization .

Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB &apos;s .
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin .
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , blood pressure is 130/80 , pulse 74 and regular , respirations 14 .
Her chest demonstrated bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular exam :
the jugular venous pressure was seven centimeters , carotid upstroke normal .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 was normally split .
There was an S4 , no S3 , grade II/VI apical murmur in systole , no rubs .
The abdomen was benign , unremarkable .
Extremities :
no calf tenderness or peripheral edema .
Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications .
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion .
The left main coronary artery was clear .
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view .
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis .
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery .
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation .
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation .
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone .
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 .
The patient had no further angina .
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study .
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris .
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall .
This was consistent with scar .
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program .
The patient is to return to the follow up care of Dr. Ko Kollciem at the Diy Hospital .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Gait ataxia .
2. Communicating hydrocephalus .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES :
Lumbar puncture 3/5/94 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Cimetidine 400 mg po b.i.d. ; aspirin 80 mg po q.d. ; Ventolin two puffs q.i.d. ;
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75-year-old right handed man with a past history of migraine , peripheral neuropathy , gait ataxia , and microvascular leukomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging study , was admitted because of an abrupt worsening of walking .
He had a history of progressive gait ataxia since 1989 , worsening over the past few months , and a recent decline in memory and concentration .
Migraine headaches with visual changes , headache and photophobia had been present for many years .
A peripheral neuropathy was first diagnosed in 1989 , cause undetermined .
Increased imbalance occurred in 1991 , at which time he was unable to walk tandem and swayed on the Romberg test .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed atrophy and microvascular leukomalacia .
He had an episode of headache , flashing light , confusion and possible loss of consciousness in November , 1993 , at which time an magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was unchanged and MRA was negative .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
He was alert and fully oriented , but had some trouble remembering current events and made one error in the Tom and Bill story after ten minutes .
There was no aphasia .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Slight left iliopsoas weakness .
Tendon reflex is absent .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
No Hoffmann reflexes .
No frontal lobe release signs .
Coordination normal .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until March 5 , at which time 40 cc were removed .
The cerebrospinal fluid was benign .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. Fyfeshuff on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in one month .
If there is significant deterioration of gait , shunt treatment will be reconsidered .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Carotid stenosis .
2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pain .
A cardiac catheterization in 07/93 showed diffuse mid left anterior descending of 90% , 30% D1 and 70% circumflex .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room and tolerated the procedure well .
His intensive care unit stay was notable for intensive care unit psychosis which was treated with Haldol and Ativan .
He slowly resolved and became alert and oriented times three .
He was ambulating well .
He had a psychiatry consult who agreed with the management .
His blood pressure control was somewhat difficult in the intensive care unit .
He received beta blockers both po and IV .
This caused him to become bradycardic down to the rate of 40 &apos;s .
It was felt that he was not a beta blocker candidate postoperatively .
Therefore , his pressure control will be done with hydralazine and could later be controlled with another agent as his cardiologist sees fit .

Discharge Date :
04/15/1990
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 73 year old white female with a history of pancreatic cancer treated with 5-FU and a vague history of chest pain , admitted with EKG changes of unclear duration , consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction .
In March of 1989 , she presented with painless jaundice , and a workup included pancreatic cancer .
She underwent a Whipple procedure and a cholecystectomy .
Four months prior to admission , she had occasional band like chest pain across her entire chest .
In January of 1989 , she was begun on 5-FU for five days of treatment followed by three weeks of no treatment .
Since then , she has had occasional lower sternal chest pain when lying on her side , reproducible by palpation .
Two weeks prior to admission , she had a presyncopal episode but did not lose consciousness .
There were no other symptoms .
One day prior to admission , she was seen at the Dagreat Health for 5-FU , her third cycle .
She complained of chest pain and back pain , and an EKG was obtained which showed new Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , and T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , consistent with an anterior septal myocardial infarction .
She was reviewed by the cardiologists and was admitted for further evaluation of her myocardial infarction .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Include smoking and increased cholesterol .
There is no diabetes , hypertension , or family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes (1) pancreatic cancer , status post a Whipple procedure , on 5-FU .
(2) Status post a cholecystectomy , appendectomy , and hysterectomy .
(3) Fibrocystic breast disease .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include 5-FU and Percocet for pain , Zantac , and Simethicone .
She has no known drug allergies .
She smoked up until ten years ago .
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an elderly white female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 97.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate of 72 , and a respiratory rate of 20 .
Her physical examination is notable for an essentially entirely normal physical examination .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , includes a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 312 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
The CK was 89 .
The urinalysis showed 5-10 white blood cells .
There were two red blood cells .
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 , axis -30 degrees , Q &apos;s in V1-V3 , T-wave inversions in V1-V5 , new in comparison to June of 1985 .
The chest x-ray showed a slightly increased cardiac size .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Dagreat Health Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
The patient was started on Ecotrin and a beta blocker as well as Isordil and Diltiazem for the possibility of 5-FU induced vasal spasm .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. Liermfelsbelb .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
She will be followed up by Dr. Liermfelsbelb .
PROBLEM # 4 :
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged in stable condition , and is to be followed up with Dr. Liermfelsbelb .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and Ecotrin one tablet p.o. q.d.
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. Liermfelsbelb .
Her diet is a low cholesterol diet .

IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old man , who was transferred from Tlowepeh Hospital after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest pain .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
In 1960 , the patient had an MI complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .
At that time he was placed on Quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
He also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .
On 12/15/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
He went to the Tlowepeh Hospital Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
He was ruled in for a non-Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on 12/17 , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Quinidine level on 12/16 was 1.4 .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on 12/18 .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both 12/17 three times , 12/19 one time , and 12/21 .
The episode on 12/21 was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .
On 12/22 , he was transferred to Norri Hospital for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
B12 IM , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , Diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , Diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , Quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , Halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Nitrol Paste , Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , Slow-K two tablets p.o.q.d. , Captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and Carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left-sided CVA in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .
Status post cholecystectomy , status post right inguinal herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
His one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the right than the left .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
Pre-intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 18 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
He was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
On the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - 4/1/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram 3/27/93 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in March , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to June , 1992 .
Later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. Patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. Breun &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. Breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. Wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

DISCHARGE DATE :
08-23-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Intracerebral hemorrhage .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .
At baseline , he had lived with his guardians , Pandeprob , he was &quot; slow &quot; , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching TV and smoking .
He had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .
A recent head computerized tomography scan in 01/92 was negative .
He had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .
He was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .
He had not had any recurrence .
He had history of alcohol abuse in the past .
There was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .
His blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .
The general medical examination was noted for bilateral temporal wasting .
His oropharynx was clear .
His skin was clear .
The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
Motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was mass effect and some midline shift .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on 07/17/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on 7/27/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
He followed all commands readily .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on 08/08/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
07-01-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
07-26-93
DISCHARGED TO SOUTHOBASSKING&apos;S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
7/21/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
06/29/93 - white cell scan ; 07/03/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to O Center in Sondibrid Ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Further evaluation at Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m.
Autopsy permission was granted .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease for more than twenty years who presented to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .
She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is remarkable for a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .

Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The carotids were normal .
The chest was clear .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The first sound was normal .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .
The patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .
She was transferred in stable condition to the Pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CML .
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1. STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .

ADMISSION DATE :
03/29/2002
DISCHARGE DATE :
04/04/2002 Mr. Rule is a 74 year old right handed male who was transferred to the Neurology Service for stroke evaluation .
Mr. Rule on March 26 at 1 PM had the acute onset of dizziness , headache , right arm and leg weakness as he was getting to stand up from watching TV .
He went to Ton University Hospital where a head CT was performed that showed no evidence of bleed .
The patient notes that approximately 7 hours later he was able to move his arm but remained unable to move his legs .
Initial blood pressure on presentation was recorded at 83/47 .
He was treated with aspirin .
MRI was performed that revealed an acute stroke in the left ACA distribution .
MRA revealed question of significant left internal carotid stenosis just proximal to the cavernous portion of the carotid .
For this lesion and question of possible intervention the patient was transferred to Tonwalkma Hospital .
General Neurosurgery Service on March 29th .
On initial exam the patient was noted to have full left sided strength .
His right upper extremity was found to be 5 - out of 5 .
His right iliopsoas was 3 out of 5 .
Quads and hamstrings 3+ out of 5 and more distally 4 out of 5 .
The patient was ambulating with a walker .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis reportedly secondary to NSAID use .
Lower GI bleeds including 1999 while on aspirin , reported negative EGD and colonoscopy .
Hypercholesterolemia .
Gout .
Depression .
CAD , status post CABG .
BPH .
Anemia .
Atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 .
EF 45% .
Medications on transfer :
Aspirin , multivitamins .
Lipitor .
Flomax .
Allopurinol .
Folic acid .
Phoslo .
Zantac .
Colace .
Subq heparin .
Of note the patient had not been on aspirin prior to his admission at the outside hospital .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient quit tobacco 45 years ago .
Two drinks of alcohol per day .
Allergies :
no known drug allergies On initial physical examination on March 30th the patient &apos;s blood pressure was 120/60 .
He was afebrile .
His heart was irregularly irregular with a III out of VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
His neurological examination was notable for fluent speech and intact mental status .
Cranial nerves which were normal .
On motor examination he had a slight right pronator drift with trace weakness in the right proximal upper extremity .
In the right leg he was initially 0 out of 5 in the iliopsoas and distally .
However several hours later in the morning he was 3 out of 5 of the iliopsoas , quads and hamstrings .
0 out of 5 more distally .
Sensory exam was intact to all modalities in the upper extremities .
He had decreased vibration in the lower extremities bilaterally .
Reflexes were not able for relative hyperreflexia in the right upper extremity with 2 out of 2 triceps , biceps , brachial radialis , 1 out of 2 triceps , biceps , brachial radialis on the left .
0 patella and ankle jerks bilateral .
Cerebellar exam :
He had normal finger to nose .
LABORATORY DATA :
unremarkable
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Neuro :
The patient was started on heparin for concern of embolic ACA stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation or possibly artery to artery embolus given his left carotid stenosis .
The patient continued on hemodialysis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
CTA revealed patent ACA &apos;s with dominant left A1 segment , hypoplastic right A1 segment but good filling of anterior cerebrals bilaterally .
It did show stenosis of the left carotid proximal to the cavernous portion .
However it did show contrast throughout .
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
2. Renal :
He contined on hemodialysis and was started on Renogel and Nephrocaps for high phosphorus levels .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In 03/09 , she was admitted to Abrat Hospital with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
She underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .
On 10/30/02 she presented to the Abrat Hospital again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at Abrat Hospital showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to Bri Health for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
O2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .
HEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .
Neck was soft and supple .
JVP flat .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
2+ bilateral femoral pulses without bruits .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This patent was admitted to Memasound Honvanta Hospital .
On 11/8/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
She was seen in consultation by Neurology .
She underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .
MRI was recommended , and on 11/12 she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
Throughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
In order to evaluate this , on 10/21 she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
She underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
No obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

Blood cultures were done for a possible rectosigmoid mass or fistula and a CT showed questionable abscess versus tumor in the left lower quadrant .
Blood cultures done on 11/17/03 grew C. perfringens .
Other blood culture was negative .
On 11/20/03 , a PE protocol CT was negative for both DVT and PE .
The patient was taken to the operating room for bilateral stent placement , resection of the pelvic mass , lysis of adhesions , left ureterolysis , rectosigmoid resection , SBR , removal of a vaginal tumor , omentectomy complicated by an enterotomy and was admitted to the ICU postoperatively on 11/21/03 .
Postoperative course by systems is as follows :
1. Neuro :
She had a PCEA for pain , then a Dilaudid PCA .
The patient was anxious with depression poorly controlled until 12/14/03 .
The patient was seen by Onc Psychiatry consult , who recommended imipramine 75 mg ; that was subsequently increased to 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. , trazadone 100 mg q.h.s. and Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has baseline hypertension that was difficult to control .
In the ICU , the patient was on enalapril , hydralazine and labetalol .
After a Cardiology consulton 12/13/03 , the patient was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. .
Hydralazine was stopped .

At the time of transfer to the ________ Onc Service , blood pressure was within the normal range .
3. Pulmonary :
The patient was extubated on 11/22/03 .
Once the patient was extubated , after the third surgery , the patient could not be weaned off 2 liters of nasal cannula and was to ______ to 20 breaths per minute despite nebulizer treatment .
The patient was restarted on Advair and by 12/15/03 , was weaned to room air likely an effective Advair and control of anxiety and psychiatric issues .
4. GI :
On postoperative day 4 , after the initial surgery , the patient had increased shortness of breath and tachycardia with abdominal pain .
A chest x-ray revealed increased free air under the diaphragm .
A CT revealed a large amount of free air .
The patient was taken to the OR on postop day 5 for emergent exploratory laparotomy that disclosed a small bowel enterotomy with 2 liters of bilious fluid within the peritoneum .
On postop day 9 , the patient had a similar increased abdominal pain episode and was taken back to the operating room for another emergent exploratory laparotomy revealing another peroration at the site of previous repair .
Intraoperatively , the patient suffered hypotension with induction and respiratory insufficiency .
The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated with stable .
The patient was kept NPO with an NG tube until postop day 14 and_____ started on clear sips with TPN for nutritional supplementation .
The patient intermittently tolerated diet advancement , but then would vomit and would have the NG tube replaced .
The patient , at the time of transfer , was tolerating clears with low stoma output , likely to tolerate slow advancement .
The patient still had a PICC line at the time , although TPN was being held and calorie counts were done to evaluate the benefit of p.o. nutrition .
5. GU :
No issues .
The patient generally had good urine output .
Presumably , should follow up with the Urology Clinic for removal of the ureteral stents at some point .

The patient was started on empiricvancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl after the second exploratory laparotomy .
She was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , doxycycline and fluconazole .
Blood cultures drawn on 12/01/03 were negative .
JP drain was cultured on 12/11/03 along with aurine culture .
TLC , TIB and blood culture were all negative .
These were cultured because the patient &apos;s white blood count was increasing to the mid 20s without fever or other symptoms for explanation .
The patient , at the time of transfer , to the Gyn / Onc Service was not antibiotics and the white blood cell count was trending down .
7. Heme :

Admission Date :
03/11/1995
Report Status :
Signed Discharge
Date :
03/24/1995
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Tennis is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the Utal Health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. Kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He has had numerous interval admissions to Shoreale Medical Health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. Carbon , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
The morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .

Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Saturation was 98% in room air .
On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .
Reflexes were less than 1+ symmetrically .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On 3/22 , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .
He was discharged on March 24th with follow-up of his PT / PTT values on Friday , the 25th , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with Dr. Most within two weeks .

DIAGNOSIS :
1. Sick sinus syndrome .
2. Pulmonary congestion .
3. Status post mitral valve replacement , with a porcine valve , and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery .
4. Chronic obstructive lung disease .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A temporary pacemaker on 5/4/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on 5/5/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on 5/6/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce .

Report Status :
Unsigned Discharge Date :
07/31/1997
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ASCENDING AORTIC DISSECTION PROCEDURE PERFORMED :
07/26/97 , repair of chronic type A aortic dissection with selective circulatory arrest using a right axillary artery cannulation and innominate artery occlusion , reconstruction of non coronary sinus ( super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 ) , reinforced with felt strip .
Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. List is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On December 29 , 1996 , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to Drain Hospital .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to En&apos;s Healthcare for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
January 2 CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
January 4 , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
January 23 , 1996 , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .
The patient has had dyspnea on exertion since January , 1996 , increasing in the last month , and increasing abdominal distention .
The patient denies history of myocardial infarction or chest pain .
She does have shortness of breath and pedal edema .
She has had atrial fibrillation for five years .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She does orthopnea of three to four pillows .
No syncope but she occasionally has dizziness .
The patient underwent CT scan on Jul 24 , 1997 , which demonstrated dissection of the ascending and archaorta to the root .
CT scan also demonstrated stable descending thoracic dissection with resolution of luminal compression .

Occasional ethanol .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa , which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
Her medications on admission were aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Trandate 200 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; Prevacid 30 milligrams p.o. q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
Neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
There was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on Jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on Jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on Jul 26 , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
Postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and Levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
She will follow-up with Dr. Spotted in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 milligrams q.4h. alternating with Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 milligrams inhaler q.4h. ; digoxin 0.25 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Lasix 60 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. times ten days , continuation or discontinuation of this medication per Cardiology ; K-Dur 40 mEqp .o. q.d. times ten days ; Glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; sliding scale regular insulin q.a.c and h.s. ; Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain ; Lopressor 75 milligrams p.o.b.i.d.; Premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; Colace 100 milligramsp .o. t.i.d. ; Captopril 37.5 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. ; enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME :
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading .
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on 1/6/0004 which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -&gt; cypher stented successfully .
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia .
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 .
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control .
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site .
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex .
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers .
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter .
He will followup with Dr. Levels in device clinic in 4 weeks .
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray 10/10/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
EKG :
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , good .

DIS
Admission Date :
01/12/1991
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
01/20/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from Bri Health with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .

Calcium 11.8 .
Albumin 2.3 .
Hematocrit was 30.6 .
White blood cell count was 11.14 .
PT was 13.2 .
PTT was 29.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from Bri Health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
Erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .
Serum markers were normal .
The CEA was less than 0.7 .
The hCG on admission was 30,710 and on 1/19 was 805 .

Hypercalcemia :
The patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .
She received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .
The patient was then switched to po etidronate .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .
Impending spinal cord compression :
The patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .
The MRI scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of T10 .
She was started on Decadron and on 1/17 began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( T2 to T5 and T9 to T11 ) .
Per the patient &apos;s wishes , Dr. Dalywoo Droreite the Windgo Hospital was consulted for a second opinion regarding the management of her malignancy .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .
He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .
On 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

WORD DISABILITY AND PROBABLY DURATION :
The patient is disabled .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from Daleglo Medical Center with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the Daleglo Medical Center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in April of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the Ph University Of Medical Center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .
I will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .
My direct pager is 935-131-3314 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .

Her neck showed no JVD .
Lungs clear to auscultation .
Her abdomen was obese and distended with good bowel sounds , large ventral hernia .
Colostomy with black stool .
She had some mid epigastric tenderness and no rebound .

She had no evidence of asterixis .
Her skin looked very bronze and tan , especially in the sun exposed areas .
She had no spider angiomata , no palmar erythema , no xanthomas and no caput medusae .
She did not look teric ( ??? ) .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
The family also reported that the patient &quot; collapsed &quot; one day prior to admission , as her legs gave out .
Her PO intake has also decreased .
She was brought to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Ward by ambulance , where she was found to be confused , oriented to self and family only , and with dry mucous membranes .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain or abdominal pain .
The patient has a history of major depression / psychotic depression since at least 1988 .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
Currently the patient is unable to provide history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As outlined above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
vitamin B12 shots monthly .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Mother with depression .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The vital signs revealed blood pressure 150/83 , heart rate 84 , respirations 20 per minute and temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
She answers inappropriately to questions .
She is not cooperative with the full neurological examination but she did move all four extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. Lornsook Trusmoag , PhD , telephone number 959-1490 .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. Fleetheesc in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
They recommended that a cytology sample be obtained and sent and that the patient be treated with a 14 day course of Keflex .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. Freieslowkays .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. Freieslowkays on January 8 , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital .
The phone number is 610-7597 .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient &apos;s baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the Ph University Of Medical Center .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
vitamin B12 shots q. month , Colace 100 mg PO t.i.d. and Carafate one gram PO q.i.d.

Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
SVR 943 .
Angiography showed an occluded SVG graft to OM1 , patent SVG graft to the RCA , patent LIMA to the LAD .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient received 600 cc of contrast and the PTCA procedure took approximately three hours .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on 11/4/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 25 on 11/4/92 .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on 11/5 .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
He is to be discharged home on 11/6 with follow-up with Dr. Kote , his cardiologist and with Dr. Right , his hematologist .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included Levoxine , 0.1 mg po q day ; diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Leukeran , 2 mg po two q a.m. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day .
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition .

Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old right hand dominant white female who presented with recurrent tumor in the left CP angle and middle fossa .
She is followed by Dr. Brendniungand Fossa and Dr. Telshey Swatlleebtik .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is unremarkable until 1977 when she developed left eye and face pain , accompanied by numbness .
A computerized tomography scan was felt to be normal .
In 1989 , she started developing incoordination in her left upper extremity .
A magnetic resonance imaging study at that time revealed a left CPA tumor with pontine compression .
This tumor was partially resected in 08/89 with nondiagnostic pathology , finally labeled as a hamartoma .
She was followed with serial imaging studies .
She had developed increasing tumor growth and increasing symptoms over the past three months , consisting of decreased ambulation , frequent falls and unable to get up the stairs of a bus due to proximal weakness .
She also noticed loss of balance .
In 05/93 , she had a magnetic resonance imaging study that revealed a large complex extra-axial mass centered in the left CPA with marked mass effect on the brainstem , left temporal lobe and the left parapharyngial space .
There was no change compared with a previous study of 12/92 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was positive for an injury to the right third finger with a soiled razor blade .
Wound was clean .
No tetanus shot had been received .
FAMILY HISTORY :
The family history is negative for brain tumor or neurologic disease .

On neurological examination , she was alert with normal cognitive function .
Her affect is a bit anxious .
Her pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , 4 to 2 millimeters , direct and consensually .
Fields were full , extra ocular movements were full with bilateral end gaze nystagmus .
Sensory to the face was markedly diminished to pin prick , light touch and temperature over V1 and V2 and to a lesser degree V3 .
There was a minimal corneal reflex and no response to nasal tickle on the left .
Motor to the face was intact .
Vision was intact bilaterally .
Jaw was strong .
Hearing was intact on the right , severely limited on the left .
Palate and tongue were midline .
Head was turned well to the right , decreased somewhat to the left and gag was present bilaterally .
Strength was full on the right side and 5-/5 in the left trapezius , deltoid , ECR , triceps , ankle flexion , ankle extension and extensor hallucis longus , and 4+ iliopsoas .
The deep tendon reflexes revealed 3+ in the lower extremities , 2+ in the upper extremities , upgoing toe on the left and a question of an upgoing toe versus withdrawal on the right .
There was no ocular dysmetria or speech dysarthria .
Her regular gait was unsteady and tandem gait was quite unstable .
The rapid alternating movements , fine finger movements , finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were all decreased on the left .
In addition , there was question of some upgaze nystagmus and diminished upgaze in the left eye , perhaps to 90%. .
LABORATORY DATA :
Admission labs were unremarkable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 11/8/93 a left frontal temporal craniectomy was done and an extensive subtotal removal was done .
Complete resection of the tumor was not possible due to its involvement with the brain stem .
The patient tolerated the procedure well , however developed a more complete fifth cranial nerve palsy in the V1 to V2 distributions , a new sixth nerve palsy , and postoperatively had a transient seventh nerve palsy which was almost completely resolved at the time of discharge .
She was discharged to rehabilitation for an approximately two week stay .
She is using an eye patch which greatly relieves her discomfort due to the diplopia .
She underwent a slow Solu-Medrol taper over two weeks .
She complained of persistent neck stiffness , likely secondary to a chemical meningitis .
Her wound remained clean and dry and she was discharged to rehabilitation after a computerized tomography scan without contrast was performed for postoperative assessment .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tegretol 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Cimetidine 300 mg PO q6h while on steroids , and a Solu-Medrol taper as indicated .
She will return to Dr. Fossa &apos;s office .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient was started on a Morphine drip for control .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
The patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his PIP from 60 to 45 .
On 12/10/91 , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
Consultation with Dr. Test led to a plan to begin aerosolized Pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of Pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via IV .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
The patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .
The patient was started on Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 hours for presumed sepsis .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
The patient &apos;s condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .
The patient &apos;s oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .
The patient &apos;s electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .
On the morning of 12/11/91 , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of Neo-Synephrine .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
The patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 A.M.
Medications at the time of death :
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 39 year old white female , gravida I , para l , with a history of recurrent stage lB cervical carcinoma .
She was originally diagnosed with cervical cancer in May of l989 .
She was staged as lB and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .
She underwent a radical hysterectomy .
There were positive margins and positive nodes .
in December of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .
Cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .
A CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .
A biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .
Between March and May of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .
In June of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in July of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .
Her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .
Also in July of l99l , she had right hip pain .
There was a bony metastasis .
Orthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .
On July 30 through August 4 of l99l , she received her first cycle of Ifosfamide and Mesna .
She had prolonged neutropenia and on August 28 , she was admitted with a headache .
CT scan at that time was normal .
She had non-focal findings per the Neurology Service .
On September 6 , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of Carboplatin , Ifosfamide , and Mesna .
Since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .
She also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks .
She was started on Zovirax on October 3 .
She presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Radical hysterectomy in May of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in July of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in December of l990 .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Spontaneous vaginal delivery times three .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Zovirax 200 mg five times daily , Methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and Ativan p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure was ll0/70 , heart rate 84 , and temperature 97.4 .
HEENT :
No thyromegaly .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm .
there was no distinct costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Slightly distended .
There was mild tenderness to palpation in the right mid lateral abdomen .
There were no peritoneal signs and no guarding .
There were normal bowel sounds .
EXTREMITIES :
Without edema .
PELVIC :
By Dr. Friednantflirt revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .
There was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Her electrolytes were within normal limits , her BUN was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .
Her ALT was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .
Her admission CBC revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
Due to Dr. Friednantflirt &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the Im Villtro University Medical Center Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
They noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .
However , they felt that at the Venbonlea Health , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .
The plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with Im Villtro University Medical Center next week .
On the evening of 12/26/06 , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .

Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By systems -
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES :
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is stable on discharge .
The patient is to be transferred to Paw.ryfear Medical Center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .
Feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .

On consultation the patient admitted to dysphasia and periods of diplopia in the past .
The patient was found to have weakness in the proximal muscles as well as the capability of the muscles .
He was started on IV ig and IV Solu-Medrol for a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis given his past history of thymoma .
He markedly improved after a dose of Mestinon .
He completed a five-day course of IV ig .
His work up included acetylcholine esterase , receptor antibodies , thyroglobulin antibody is pending .
An ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative .
Sed rate was 58 and repeat 75 .
EMG studies were performed , the result is pending at the time of this dictation .
He also had a repeat chest CT which showed a question of recurrence of the thymoma .
Thoracic Surgery was consulted and recommended repeating the CT scan in six weeks as an outpatient .
This could represent either recurrence of scar tissue .
The patient was tapered to p.o. prednisone and tolerated Mestinon 30 mg q. 4h with 180 mg longacting at bedtime .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Ms. Pa is a 67 year old woman with a history notable for congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , transient ischemic attacks and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Over the few months prior to admission the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing weight gain to the tune of approximately 30 lbs despite increasing diuresis by her primary care physician .
An echocardiogram at the Ph University Of Medical Center in 1997 revealed a normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormality .
By her primary care physicians report an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in June 1999 revealed mild left atrial enlargement and mild right ventricular dilatation .
The primary care physician also reports an increasing new mitral regurgitation murmur over the past several weeks .
The patient has a Persantin Thallium stress test at an outside hospital on 11/22/99 which reportedly was negative for ischemia .
She has had no chest pain .
She does not smoke and has no history of coronary artery disease .
Three days prior to admission , secondary to increasing difficulty with ambulation and dyspnea on exertion the patient was admitted to a nursing home .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Early on the morning of admission the patient was found down , diaphoretic and responsive only to sternal rub .
She had a witnessed seizure-like episode .
Her blood sugar was 48 .
Emergency Medical Service was called .
The patient was intubated , given thiamine and D50 as well as intravenous Lasix and she was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room .
In the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room she was afebrile with a blood pressure 150/80 , heart rate in the 60s , oxygen saturation of 100% .
She was arousable to sternal rub only .
She had minimal crackles bilaterally and had an unremarkable electrocardiogram .
Her chest x-ray showed only mild failure .
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .

Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Plasma sodium 134 , plasma carbon dioxide 34.8 , blood urea nitrogen 67 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 165 , liver function tests were normal .
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Urine analysis showed no urinary tract infection .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
KUB showed no bowel obstruction .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
1. ENDOCRINE :
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
She will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a CZI sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
4. PULMONARY :
The patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation .
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
5. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .
She will be discharged on a one week course of Augmentin .
The patient was discharged to her chronic care facility on 11/27/99 in stable condition .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol nebs 2.5 mg po q4h as needed .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sepsis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease ; diabetes mellitus ; necrotizing fasciitis of the right leg and pelvis ; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; hypertension ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; peripheral vascular disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
8/22/96 , drainage of intraabdominal abscess .
8/21/96 , incision and drainage of right thigh .
9/3/96 , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Daie Elms was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Cyclosporin A .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Minipress .
Digoxin .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Lasix .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Elms was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on 8/21/96 for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
There appeared to be a component of necrotizing fasciitis to this , and he was taken back to the operating room the next day for incision and drainage of a pelvic abscess and intraabdominal abscess .
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On 9/3/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On 11/26/96 , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. Elms was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He continued to deteriorate until 12/3/96 , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on 12/3/96 .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

Carotid arteries showed normal upstroke and volume without bruits bilaterally .
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was a left parasternal lift .
There was a loud Sl and a physiologically split S2 with a prominent P2 component .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
The patient &apos;s peripheral pulses were full .
There was no evidence of edema in the extremities .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .
She was having difficulty remembering certain events which had occurred that day .
It was felt that because her neurological examination was non-focal at this time and that these changes represented no real change in her mental status from the time of admission , that no further work-up was required .

He was admitted to Vassdiysey Medical Center with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in January 1994 , and August 1994 .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to Free Medical Center .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
A computerized tomography scan done on 4/16/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .

EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On 4/17/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

DISCHARGE DATE :
12/29/96
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Electrical cardioversion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance .
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% .
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance .
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 .
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS :
Include Cardizem CD 180 mg daily ; Monopril 10 mg daily ; Digoxin .25 mg daily ; and Lasix 40 mg every other day .
ALLERGIES :
To Quinidine , Procardia , and sulfa antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination , blood pressure was 200/100 ; heart rate 120 per minute ( atrial fibrillation ) .
The patient was noted to be anxious .
There was no neck vein distension or carotid bruits .
Heart sounds were normal .
The lungs were clear .
The abdominal examination was benign .
There was no peripheral edema .
Pulses were all easily palpable .
LABORATORY DATA :
A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a QT interval of .46 seconds .
There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific .
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits .
INR was elevated at 2.5 .
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 .
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in Ownra Cin , New Mexico on 12/06/96 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this .
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules .
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days .
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 .
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today .
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut .
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone .
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun &apos;s office here .
MEDICATIONS :
Other than the addition of Amiodarone 200 mg daily , will be the same as her admission medications .

DEATH
SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , 03/13/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in 04/17 and 07/15 , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of 03/13/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the 14th of March , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
On 03/14/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on 03/15/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On 03/16/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of 03/16/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 03/17/00 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Unstable angina pectoris .
2. Congestive heart failure .
3. Chronic renal failure , hemodialysis dependent .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
5/18/99 Coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and posterior left ventricular artery and the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with accelerating angina pectoris , who had a cardiac catheterization at Chimass Community Hospital revealing three-vessel disease .
The patient was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for a cardiac surgical evaluation .
The patient &apos;s cardiac history has been known for several years .
In 05/96 , the patient had a cardiac catheterization that revealed a moderate right coronary artery ostial lesion , severe lesion at the ostial PLV , 50-60% circumflex lesion , 40% proximal left anterior descending , and severe proximal D1 .
The patient was admitted to the Bitamp Memorial on 5/11/99 , having had three episodes of chest pain .
Her CKs were found to be elevated with a peak of 1237 with only one increase in MB fractionation .
She had a repeat cardiac catheterization at Chimass Community Hospital on 5/13/99 , which showed three-vessel disease , including right coronary artery 70% ostial , left anterior descending 70% , circumflex 100% .
Her ejection fraction was estimated at 60% .
There was 1 mitral regurgitation .
The patient was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought to the operating room on 5/18/99 , where a coronary artery bypass graft x 4 was performed .
The bypasses are listed above .
The bypass time was 2 hours , 19 minutes , cross-clamp time was 1 hour , 36 minutes .
The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells .
She received 1 unit of normal saline .
Postoperatively , the patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
The patient arrived at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on dopamine at 150 , epinephrine at .25 , levofloxacin at 7 , Xylocaine at 1.5 , Nitroglycerin at 150 , Fentanyl / Versed drip at 8 .
Her sedation was weaned and she was extubated as per protocol .
Her chest tubes were removed , as per protocol .
The patient was weaned off her pressors and was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the Goman 12 Mini-Unit on postoperative day 1 .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was routine .
Prior to her transfer to the Goman 12 Unit , her last cardiac index in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit had been between 2.0 and 2.2 .
2. Renal :
The patient was dialyzed , as stated above , and had fluid taken off in order to approach her preoperative weight .

Her hematocrit was 26.9 .
Her potassium was 4.3 .
Her creatinine was 4.2. 3 .
Endocrine :
The patient was followed by the Diabetes / Endocrine Service .
Her NPH and regular insulin doses were adjusted accordingly .
Her regular insulin consisted of insulin sliding scale .
4. Infectious Disease :
The patient was thought to have had rigors during one of her dialysis sessions .
As such , the patient was given Vancomycin and Gentamicin for levels .
However , it should be stated that all of her cultures while at Ph University Of Medical Center were negative for growth .
As such , antibiotics should not be continued .
It should be pointed out , however , that a urinalysis from 5/14/99 showed positive white blood cells .
However , this was in the setting of the patient , who more than likely has colonization of her bladder secondary to decreased to no urine output .
At the time of discharge , the patient was in satisfactory condition , tolerating good PO intake on her renal diet .

DIS
Admission Date :
01/16/1991
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
01/20/1991
HISTORY :
The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 followed a failed angioplasty .
Coincident with the angioplasty he received a large contrast load leading to the development of renal failure and hemodialysis .
He also has had bilateral carotid endarterectomy and right aorto-femoral bypass .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The carotids were one plus with bruits bilaterally .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On January 17 , 1991 , the patient had a catheterization that showed an occluded proximal right coronary artery with the PDA filling via left to right collaterals , an occluded left circumflex after the OMB2 , and a very proximal occlusion of the LAD .
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
On admission his BUN and creatinine were 7.4 and 48 .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He was discharged in stable condition on the following medications :
Procardia XL , 90 mg p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor , 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nitroglycerine 1/150 1 tab s.l. p.r.n. pain ; Nitrol patch , 10 mg q.a.m. ; iron sulfate , 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nephrocaps , 1 tab. p.o. q.d. ; Xanax , 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .

ATTENDING :
SALENE MARGGAY NORFJESCSTOOKS MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Hypoglycemia leading to question seizure , non ST-elevation MI , GI bleed , anemia .
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Question seizure / loss of consciousness with hypoglycemia , fingerstick blood sugar of 24 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
An 82-year-old male with a history of CAD status post CABG , CVA status post CEA , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , GI bleeding , CHF with an EF of 35% , left lower lobe pneumonia on admission on 01/22/04 - 01/31/2004 , PVD and bladder cancer .
The patient recently DC&apos;d to home from Erdiconre Hospital on 02/20/2004 .
The patient reports feeling increasingly weak times several days and on the morning of admission needed assistance to go to the bathroom where he had a melanotic stool .
Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the Usoak Rinix Hospital .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .
The patient at that time had slurred speech with altered mental status .
The patient at the site was given 1 amp of D50 .
Fingerstick blood sugar on repeat was 190 .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of note , in the Genearocktemp Ry Health ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
At that time the patient was thought to have non ST elevation MI ; however , family declined aggressive cardiac intervention and opted for medical management only .
Thus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for 03/17 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. Cardiovascular :
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Pump :
The patient was initially hydrated on exam ; however , the patient became euvolemic after transfusion of blood and _____ IV fluids .
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .
Repeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
Rate and rhythm :
The patient with a history of afib .
Afib was stable .
Coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
3. Endocrine :
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
4. Heme :
Hematocrit is stable .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
5. ID :
The patient was initially started on Levo 250 mg q.d. for a UTI .
However , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .
6. Pulmonary :
The patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
7. Renal :
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
His baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline .
On discharge his creatinine is 1.8 .
CODE STATUS :
Code is DNR / DNI .
TO DO PLAN :
1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. Toob Obestimeuph in two weeks .
2. The patient is to follow up with the Genearocktemp Ry Health GI Service in four weeks .
3. The patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy .
4. The patient should have q.o.d. hematocrit checks to ensure that his hematocrit is above 30 and if it is below 30 should be transfused secondary to his underlying known CAD .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs q.4h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vitamin D 5000 units p.o. q.weekly , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , regular insulin sliding scale , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neutrophos 250 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Senna 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamins with minerals one tab p.o. q.d. , trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg nebs q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Pulmicort two puffs inhaled b.i.d. and Nexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

No old EKG was available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the September , the September , the September , and the Septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Multivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , Halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and Acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tuberculosis in childhood .
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
(5) peptic ulcer disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
Chest tube placement on the right .
Endotracheal intubation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the 14th of February , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th of February , 1997 .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
He has not been considered as a candidate for a TIPPS or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant list for his blood type , B .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. Hibbslires was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of February in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the 26th of February , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. Leynslentnerswaimjesc and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. Loydbreunlinke , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the 27th of February , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the 27th of February , 1997 .
The family was present .
Dr. Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau , and Launtburce were notified .

5) PLASMACYTOMA .
6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Multiple myeloma .
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .

Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Glucose 191 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
KOTELEEBDILS , TOZA S
UNIT NUMBER :
282-52-89
ADMISSION DATE :
08/05/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
08/19/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to Ph University Of Medical Center with a fever .
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
Of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
He has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. Factor agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full Arnsperni Health services .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
Brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where Mr. Koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Rule is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on 7/8/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in April of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in March of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on 5/17/96 by Dr. Lenni Pain .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on 6/5/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. Aacent Slentjae of the Linatpromehack Worth Hospital for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on 6/20/96 .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on June 25th , 26th and 27th of 1996 , which she tolerated well .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of June .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
An MRI was performed on 6/25/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the Retelk County Medical Center Emergency Room on 7/8/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in June of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. Lenni Pain .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By 7/15/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By 7/18/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .
Ms. Rule is to follow-up with Dr. Chelkjescchalsere , who can be reached at 148-701-5440 .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prostate cancer .
2. Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient is an 87-year-old male with stage D prostate was cancer , was admitted for fluid hydration on the 10th of March .
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in August of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
Subsequent prostatic biopsy revealed a Gleason &apos;s IV , plus V tumor and the CT showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread .
There was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time .
The patient was admitted in October of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient &apos;s wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .
The patient is now admitted for fluid rehydration therapy and observation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS :
None currently .
ALLERGIES :
None .
HABITS :
No history of cigarette smoking .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is afebrile with a recumbent blood pressure of 128/16 , pulse of 76 , and standing blood pressure of 110/60 with a pulse of 88 .
Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
ABDOMEN :
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.&apos; s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient &apos;s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient &apos;s electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.&apos; s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient &apos;s urinary obstruction will be addressed .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .

END STAGE RENAL DISEASE SECONDARY TO HYPERTENSIVE
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
8-29-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
9-21-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. diverticulitis ,
2. perforated cecum ,
3. acute renal insufficiency .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on 8-29-94 .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
1. colonoscopy on 9-5-94 ,
2. colonoscopy with rectal tube placement on 9-7-94 ,
3. subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch and ileostomy on 9-10-94 ,
4. renal biopsy on 9-13-94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
He started on dialysis in 03/92 and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .
The patient is admitted for renal transplantation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
3. gout ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg PO q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on 9-8-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the EXWAGH9T protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4 , 1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6 , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25 , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia .
7. Pain .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .
Nortriptyline 25 mg. po. qhs .
KCL 40 mEq. po. bid .
Saline wet to dry dressing changes three times daily to penis and pelvis decubiti , 40% humidified oxygen , Fluconazole 200 mg. po. bid .
Lasix 2.5 mg. intravenous qid .
Prilosec 20 mg. po. qd .
Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. po. qhs prn .
Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3 hours prn .
Physicians that took care of this patient while at the Ph University Of Medical Center are as follows :
Admitting Physician and Thoracic Surgeon :

In summary this is a 25 year old male with a very complicated history and a patient of Dr. Breunkays &apos;s .
The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this .
Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis .
The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time .
Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &apos;s home .
If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &apos;s office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &apos;s care .
Hauth is a very complicated patient and it was our pleasure to provide care for him at Ph University Of Medical Center .

TIME OF DEATH :
5/19/95 at 3:15 a.m.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stone is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Atrial fibrillation since 1990 .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
Cipro 250 mg. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa medications .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Heart rate was 110 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
After many discussions between Dr. Leickgrend , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On 4/27/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on 5/10/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On 5/14/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On 5/15/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
On 5/17 , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. Stone &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on 5/18/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on 5/19/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several PUOMC admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Bilirubin normal .
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. First &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from Capa An- Medical Center of Ohio on 07/20 for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On 08/10/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on 02/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On 07/19/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On 07/19/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Asney Ewood Health Care in Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. Fields was consulted and the patient was transferred by Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital to Ph University Of Medical Center Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. Fields on 07/20 in the p.m.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .

The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .

From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube .
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on 7/25 a.m. Dr. Fields &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
KUB on 7/23 showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on 7/24 in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The platelet count was 351,000 .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .

DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will be transferred to Ral Medical Center in Saintarv on 7/25/92 by ambulance .
The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. Fields will contact Dr. Roosekote as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. Fields wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
The parents are being transferred back to Newstonpend to learn trach care and to set up homecare .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .

Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Bronchoscopy , 3/23/95 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Po is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. Po presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the May of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By October of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on Bactrim and subsequently Clarithromycin without improvement .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
There is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. Jesclinke on 4/22/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on Mar 30 , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tagamet , 800 mg. PO q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; Carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; Ativan , 1 mg. SL q.4 p.r.n.

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on 10/18/96 .
THER PROCEDURES :
arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head CT scan on 10/14/96
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Granrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .
ALLERGIES :

5) hypertension .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .

He was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a father who had dementia .
There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
Lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
He does not regard the examiner .
He had no blink to threat .
His pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Dilantin 100 mgs po tid , Carafate 1 gram po qid , Digoxin 0.25 mgs po qd , Isordil 20 mgs po tid , Captopril 25 mgs po tid , Lopressor 50 mgs po bid , Colace 100 mgs po tid , and Coumadin 2 mgs po qhs .

Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. Sick in one weeks time .
He will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .
ADDENDUM
Mr. Marker will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in January of 1988 when a biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In 08/89 , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
He was then admitted on 9/20/90 for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on 11/9/90 at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
LESS , LIESEANALE
UNIT NUMBER :
589-25-50
ADMISSION DATE :
12/16/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/16/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .

2. STAGE III-C OVARIAN CANCER
TREATMENTS :
Chemotherapy of IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida 0 with stage IV endometrial cancer and stage III-C ovarian cancer vs metastatic endometrial cancer for line 2 , cycle 1 chemotherapy .
The patient presented in 10-90 , with heavy bleeding per vagina .
D and C showed grade II-III adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation at Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center in Com St. , Tton , Arkansas 32167 .
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at CTMC in 10-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in Pemrancetul Tonsst. .
However , during the fourth cycle , Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on 6-27-91 , was 249 and on 8-29-91 , was 734 .
In 05-92 , the patient was admitted to Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has no complaints except anxiety .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 5 mg po q d , Tagamet 400 mg po q d , Amoxicillin which was started on Labor Day , for a sore throat and Ativan 1 mg po prn nausea / anxiety .
ALLERGIES :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
She was an anxious female , in no acute distress .
HEENT exam showed PERRLA , EOMI , oropharynx benign .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard mass occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the sodium was 136 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 98 , CO2 20 , BUN 8 , creatinine 0.8 and glucose 94 , ALT 5 , AST 10 , LDH 166 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , total bili 0.6 , direct bili .3 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.8 and uric acid 3.1 .
She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
The plan was for urinalysis q d.
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .
When compared with ECG of 11-06-90 , there was borderline criteria for anterior MI although the patient denied any chest pain at any point .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC&apos;s in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC&apos;s in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient &apos;s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by 9-10 .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
However , the patient &apos;s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on 9-11 , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on 9-8 , was 36.0/68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC&apos;s .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
The patient was discharged on 9-12-92 , with the approval of her attending physiciana , Dr. Porriede Friednantflirt .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
On 9-28-92 , the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor , Dr. Jescspald , for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday , 9-14-02 .

IDENTIFICATION :
Mr. Kotefyfe is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome ( acute myelogenous leukemia ) who presents 20 days status post a nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplant and is admitted for fatigue , neutropenia , and an abnormal chest x-ray .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In January 2002 , the patient was found to be anemic .
He was monitored closely and started on folic acid .
In August 2002 , a bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with a 12p abnormality in 14/24 metaphases .
He was treated with 5-azacytidine due to increasing number of blasts .
After four treatment cycles , his marrow remained hypercellular with persistent low levels of blasts .
In September 2004 , the patient converted to AML with Philadelphia chromosome 9:12 and received induction chemotherapy and recovered slowly with blasts .
In November 2005 , a bone marrow biopsy showed 80% cellularity and 40% of the intratrabecular space was composed of AML cells .
Hydrea was started due to splenic pain .
The patient was admitted on December 5 , 2005 for many &quot; peripheral blood stem cell transplants . &quot;
This course was without major complications .
Since his discharge from the hospital one week ago , he had twin graft to stem cells .
He has had only a few polys on his white blood cell differential .
He has also had persistent blasts of 1 to 2% .
The patient was taken off GMCSF because of splenic pain and this pain improved .
He has not been febrile .
He has had transfusions on several occasions .
His white blood cell count and platelet count have been noted to be steadily rising over the past week .
He actually looked a little bit better today than he had previously .
For the past three days , he has been complaining of pain in his shoulder with motion and also a little bit of pain in his left lower quadrant .
A chest x-ray obtained demonstrated a right lobe infiltrate , which was possibly fungal in etiology and the patient has been admitted for further evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
AML , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 1989 with stent placement , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and scrofula in a lymph node .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which causes a rash .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Atenolol 25 mg daily , folic acid , Prilosec 40 mg daily , tacrolimus 2 mg q.a.m. , 1 mg q.p.m. , fluconazole ( started five days prior to admission to treat thrush ) , acyclovir 400 mg t.i.d. , Mepron 750 mg b.i.d. , Levaquin 500 mg daily , oxycodone 5 to 10 mg q.3h. p.r.n. for pain , and doxazosin .

Chest x-ray revealed a right upper infiltrate .
Chest CAT scan was notable for right upper lobe consolidation and right pleural effusion .
All findings consistent with pneumonia .
HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
Mr. Lyfranklapalm Kote is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that could vary to acute myelogenous leukemia who is status post a nonmyeloablative allogenic transplants via protocol of 27-518 , the GVAX study , who was readmitted for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The remainder of the dictation will be divided by system :
1. Oncology :
The patient is status post nonmyeloablative &quot; many allogenic bone marrow transplant on 12/12/04 .
Neutrophils have yet twin graft , GMCSF was stopped in a setting of increased splenic pain .
Throughout this admission , the patient has had a climbing level of blasts ( 44% on the day of discharge ) consistent with recurrent leukemic disease .
All immunosuppressants were discontinued except for tacrolimus .
Tacrolimus was continued at a reduced dose to 0.5 mg daily , so that the patient could remain on the GVAX study .
2. ID / Pulmonary :
Admission CAT scans and x-rays of the chest were notable for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The patient was afebrile upon admission and remained afebrile throughout his course .
Infectious Disease and Pulmonary Services were actively involved during this admission .
Both Consultant Services felt the initial imaging was consistent with focal fungal ( question Aspergillus or Mucor ) infiltrates .
He was started empirically .
He was started empirically on Voriconazole .
Given the patient &apos;s history of scrofula , there was mild concern for possible active tuberculosis .
The patient ruled out for TB by serial sputum induction studies .
A bronchoscopy was performed .
Washings , cultures , and viral studies were negative or remained no growth to date .
CMV viral loads were all negative .
Serum galactomannan level on 01/01 was negative .
There was consideration to do a VAT procedure to obtain his definitive diagnosis , but however , in the presence of recurrent leukemic disease , the patient continued to decline this option .
Inpatient antibiotic and antiviral treatment included prophylactic acyclovir and Mepron per protocol , empiric Levaquin , empiric caspofungin , and empiric fluconazole .
The patient does have thrush .
3. Hematology :
The patient had no active bleeding during this admission .
The patient was given red blood cells and platelets to maintain his hematocrit above 26 and his platelet count above 10,000 .
4. Cardiovascular :
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
He had one brief episode of chest pain that was spontaneously resolved .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and no further workup was pursued .
5. Musculoskeletal :
The patient had a right middle finger pain , which developed during this admission without any preceding trauma .
This pain was felt to be due to arthritis .
Plain film x-rays revealed no bony injury .
6. Psych :
Celexa 20 mg daily was started this admission for treatment for depression .
FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Acute myelogenous leukemia .
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate , not otherwise specified , possibly infectious / fungus versus recurrence of leukemic disease .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
The patient was discharged to home with AH Services .
OUTPATIENT FOLLOWUP :
The patient is scheduled to see Dr. Kama Scpra who will be covering for Dr. Telshey Swatlleebtik on January 14 , 2005 at 9 a.m.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb .
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac echocardiogram .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .
Carotids were 2+ .
Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .
The patient was pronounced dead .
Patient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. Vessels .
An autopsy permission was granted .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
STATUS POST MULTIPLE EMBOLISMS AND LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS PROCEDURES :
LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBECTOMY .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In 04-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in 09-90 .
In 09-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in 01-89 , which was uncomplicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on 2-12-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on 2-14-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on 2-22-92 .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Synthroid .1 mg po q d , Metamucil one pack po q d , Persantine 50 mg po t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol cream at anal t.i.d. , Coumadin for PTT equal 20 seconds as directed , Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 h prn .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
This was discussed with the patient &apos;s local medical doctor , Dr. Royneo Walla .
The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .
He has an appointment with Dr. O Kotea for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Decadron 4 mg. o tid , Cimetidine 400 mg. po bid , Tegritol 100 mg. po qid , oxygen at 3 liters per minute .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Shuff was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center because of the development of a sudden marked increase in her level of dyspnea .
She was known to have metastatic small cell lung carcinoma for which she had been treated by Dr. Iand Bontbreun with multiple courses of chemotherapy as well as localized radiation therapy .
She had recently had cerebral metastases , which was treated by aspiration and is also known to have bone metastases .
A few days prior to admission she developed severe dyspnea .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was markedly dyspneic , sitting upright and completely unable to lie flat .
She has small amounts of active hemoptysis , no evidence of superior mediastinal syndrome .
The heart rate was 110 per minute , chest showed diffuse rhonchi throughout .
Decreased breath sounds right upper lobe .
No murmur , rub or gallop or cardiomegaly was noted .
One finger hepatomegaly was present without splenomegaly and there was no peripheral edema .
The arterial blood gases on room air sitting upright PO2 67 mm. Mercury , PCO2 42 mm. Mercury , pH 7.47. hematocrit 41.4 , sodium 123 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 88 , BUN 12 , creatinine .6 mg. % , LDH 692 , units , alkaline phosphatase 234 units , her chest X-ray showed consolidation of the right upper lobe and a markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm .
A computerized tomography scan taken in June 1995 showed marked atelectasis of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe , with marked intraolobular septal thickening , probably representing interstitial carcinoma , and a markedly dilated right hilum .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and seen in consultation by Dr. Oarekote from the Department of chemotherapy , Dr. Skizeis from Radiation Therapy , both of whom conclude that they did not have any additional therapy , which would improve her condition .
She had a bronchoscopy by Dr. Cranka , which showed diffuse involvement and narrowing of the bronchi to the right lung by extrinsic compression .
Essentially this excluded both coring or laser removal of central airway tumor as well as endobronchial brachy therapy .
Her sodium slowly increased in the hospital and was 129 mEq on discharge .
She was discharged to be cared for at home or possibly in the Hospice at Vaila Medical Center .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt on 02-19-91 .
She tolerated the procedure well and was actually , the following day , slightly drowsy , but did better than preoperatively while in the hospital .
She was able to ambulate with some assistance , was less sleepy and slow in her affect , able to swallow , passed her swallow study , and had an episode while in the house of shortness of breath , two episodes , with an electrocardiogram that did not show any change , and a chest x-ray showed a question of failure .
For this reason , a cardiology consult was called .
They recommended starting the patient on Lasix and doing cardiac echo .
On Lasix , the patient &apos;s BUN and creatinine started rising , and the echocardiogram revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular hyper-trophy and decreased compliance .
It was felt that the patient was slightly dehydrated .
Lasix was stopped .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was brought to the operating room on March 21 , 1997 , where he underwent a flexible bronchoscopy , left lower lobectomy .
He tolerated this procedure well .
postoperatively , the patient went to the respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Cardiology wise , electrocardiogram revealed no right bundle branch block although no ischemia and he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin .
Ruled out for an myocardial infarction .
The patient was subsequently transferred to Goman 25 the following day .
The patient had difficulty with chest tubes and air leak and a small pneumothorax .
This subsequently improved .
He was off oxygen , although he had some dyspnea with ambulation .
He was subsequently noted to have a large air leak , but was intrapleural .
He required surgical closure and was transferred to the operating room on April 6 , 1997 for repair of bronchopleural fistula as well as an omental flap .
This was performed on April 7 , 1997 .
postoperatively , once again returned to the PACU .
He was transfused for a hematocrit of 27 and then admitted back to Goman 25 .
The patient was bronchoscoped for several times for junky left lung fields .
He did require Albumin and continued with intravenous fluids .
Pain was well controlled with an epidural catheter .
On April 14 , 1997 , the patient was transferred to the RICU for respiratory compromise with rapid atrial fibrillation possibly due to aspiration .
He was electively intubated and was started on Clindamycin and Ofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia .
He was followed closely by infectious disease .
He was also started on total parenteral nutrition supplementation .
Mr. Stire then became lethargic and decompensated neurologically .
He continued to decompensate neurologically given his new right Babinski , and increased deep tendon reflexes on the right .
He continued to remain confused .
In the interim he did have a esophagogastroduodenoscopy and placement of post pyloric feeding tube for nutritional supplement .
Additional complications included an unexplained metabolic acidosis , decreased white count and platelet count felt to be due to the Bactrim and persistent tremors .
He was seen by neuro house staff and was felt to have worsening encephalopathy and this suspicion was secondary to brain metastases .
This was confirmed by a CT scan of the head .
He was started on Dilantin .
The patient did have several episodes of grand mal seizures and his Dilantin was adjusted to therapeutic doses .
Additional issue was an increase in BUN and creatinine .
On April 19 , 1997 , he went back to the operating room for a tracheostomy .
He continued on Decadron for edema .
He was also seen by radiation oncology and started radiation treatment .
The patient did improve on corticosteroids and seizures were well controlled with Dilantin .

DIAGNOSIS :
RECURRENT CLEAR CELL OVARIAN CARCINOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The history of present illness and PAST MEDICAL HISTORY are unavailable , because there was no History and Physical on the chart .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Synthroid .2 milligrams by mouth per day .
ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was not documented on the chart .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , hematocrit was 37 , baseline creatinine .9 .
postoperatively , her hematocrit fell to as low as 23.8 , for which she was transfused up to hematocrit of 33 and remained stable between 30 and 33 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission , where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and a 5-centimeter tumor mass was identified , which was adherent and possibly intrinsic to the sigmoid colon , and also noted were firm and large periaortic lymph nodes bilaterally .
Because of these operative findings , only a biopsy was sent , which confirmed metastatic clear cell carcinoma , and further bowel surgery was not attempted .
Postoperatively , the patient &apos;s course was complicated initially by a falling hematocrit , which was transfused and then remained stable .
The she continued to have low-grade postoperative fevers until approximately 8 days postoperatively when her temperature spiked .
A pelvic ultrasound was obtained , which showed a large fluid collection in the pelvis .
This collection was tapped and found to be blood mixed with pus .
A drain was placed under ultrasound guidance and cultures were sent .
Cultures so far have grown suspected Pseudomonas from the liquid medium only , sensitivities are pending .
The patient was placed on ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl , and the fluid collection was drained over 4 days .
The drain was removed on postoperative day #12 .
The patient remained afebrile and antibiotics were stopped .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 .
She was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .
Note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
TLANDSEUSS , CHERE C
UNIT NUMBER :
083-97-79
ADMISSION DATE :
09/15/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/23/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from Cay Memorial Hospital Of for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in January 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at Ph University Of Medical Center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in December 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. Slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On 9/2/98 he was admitted to Cay Memorial Hospital Of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
There was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
He was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on Iat .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. Taarnna Service at Ph University Of Medical Center as well as Dr. Lupevickette Folk and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach on Villean Garl .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PROGRESSIVE ACANTHAMOEBA INFECTION .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old man with refractory CLL , status post non-myeloblative stem cell transplant approximately nine months prior to admission , and status post prolonged recent Retelk County Medical Center stay for Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , complicated by ARS due to medication toxicity , as well as GVHD and recent CMV infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia .
Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on November 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .
Denies cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , neck stiffness , new skin lesions , worsening red petechiae , or increasing sinus symptoms .
Patient reports persistent mild right upper quadrant discomfort , recent poor appetite .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .
This interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course .

UNIT NUMBER :
404-91-65
ADMISSION DATE :
10/02/96
DISCHARGE DATE :
10/04/96
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 79 year old white female with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum for which she underwent a diverting colostomy in 05/96 .
This was followed by radiation .
Inspite of radiation the tumor has progressed and the patient has had intermittent rectal bleeding .
She was last admitted in 06/96 for pelvic fracture which was accompanied by bright red blood per rectum .
At this time she underwent Yag laser electrocautery and a flexible sigmoidoscopy .
Now she presents with similar bright red blood per rectum times one day .
The ostomy site is function with no gross blood , denies any nausea and vomiting or abdominal pain , no fever , chills or anorexia or dizziness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Remarkable for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum with liver metastases , long standing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , severe pneumonitis , rectal ulcers , and pelvic fracture in 06/96 .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Diverting colostomy , multiple sigmoidoscopies and Yag laser to control bleeding rectal carcinoma times two , one in 06/96 and one for this admission in September .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tylenol #3 and metered dose inhalers PRN .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HABITS :
65 pack year smoking history , denies alcohol abuse , however , strongly suspicious that the patient does drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a frail , cachectic woman in no acute distress .
The head and neck exam was unremarkable .
Chest had diffuse crackles and rales with some end expiratory wheezing .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended , flat with positive bowel sounds and functioning colostomy in the left lower quadrant with positive stool and gas in the bag .
Anoscope revealed a small 1 cm. laceration without active bleeding in the emergency room .
Her admission vital signs included a blood pressure of 99/54 , pulse 72 , respirations 20 , temperature 98.8 .
LABORATORY DATA :
Remarkable for sodium 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 98 , CO2 31.1 , BUN and creatinine 23/.9 respectively , white blood count 8 , hematocrit 31.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted from the emergency room to the floor and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells to bring up her hematocrit to approximately 36 .
On the morning of 10/3/96 at 10:30 in the morning , the patient complained of some mild shortness of breath after infusion of her second unit of packed red blood cells .
Her sat was 94% which was down from her baseline of 96 , two liter nasal prong .
The lungs had mild bibasilar rales , superimposed over baseline wheezes .
It was thought that she may have a touch of congestive heart failure secondary to transfusion .
Her intravenous fluids were held and her breathing was improved with upright posturing .
A chest x-ray showed clear lungs with respect to congestive heart failure .
Therefore the idea of pulmonary embolus was entertained although the patient had no episodes of tachycardia , chest pain or hemoptysis with her shortness of breath .
The lower extremity arterial non-invasive studies were obtained and were negative for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient underwent colonoscopy on 10/4/96 and rectal carcinoma was observed and cauterized with a Yag laser .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
EPIGLOTTITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to Ez Ephtro Health Center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at Retelk County Medical Center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to Retelk County Medical Center .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Extremities :
Normal .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .
On 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
DISPOSITION :
On 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
3/23/95
DISCHARGE DATE :
04/04/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cholangiocarcinoma , recurrent ; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On 3/28/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
On 3/24/95 , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
On 3/27/95 , 3/28/95 , 3/30/95 , 3/31/95 , and 04/04/95 there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in August of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
In September 1994 , he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts .
In October 1994 , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
He was admitted in January 1994 , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on 3/28/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On 3/31/95 and 04/04/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying pain or fever .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On 04/04/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. Blinjesc discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. Ma , in Taette .
Dr. Ma will be working with Dr. Besti Kotebreun of Ph University Of Medical Center to manage the currently indwelling stents .
The patient will continue his course of Flagyl until that is finished and he will stay on the po ofloxacin until the external draining stents are removed .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
are Glyburide 5-15 mg po q a.m. and 0-10 mg po q p.m. , depending on amount of oral intake ; Celesone 1 1/2 tablets po q day , Tagamet 400 mg PO b.i.d. , ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d. , CZI sliding scale which will not be continued on discharge , and Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for a total of fourteen days .

DISCHARGE DATE :
5/2/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma .
2. Pancytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in March , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In March 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on 4/25/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On April 26 , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On April 27 , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on May 2 .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .
The patient was instructed to call us with any clinical or neurological symptoms .
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on April

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on 05/22 with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
She had a long history of significant and complex medical issues .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the November of 1994 .
On 02/20 she was admitted to Secla Berl Spo Hospital with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She presented with wide complex tachycardia and congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital on 02/21 .
Following her hospitalization at Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital he was transferred to Louline Mauikings Medical Center , where she had a protracted hospitalization during which she was treated for congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , and uncontrolled atrial flutter rates .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I-II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
No S3 was present .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the right ; crackles were present on the left , approximately 1/3 up .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Crestwall Hospital , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on 05/24 demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on Memorial Day demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on 06/06 , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
Dr. Margmimaui Jesclinke was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of 06/30 and 07/01 , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on 07/02/94 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Cean Leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the Morehegron Valley Hospital in Ville , Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to George&apos;sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to George&apos;sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .
That was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .
Because of Mr. Leach &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. Leach &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Ticlopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. Lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. Lasix 80 mg. q.d. Kayciel 60 meq b.i.d. Cimetidine 400 mg. b.i.d. Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d. and Lodopine 10 mg. q.d. a combination of Percocet , Morphine Sulfate elixir p.o. as needed .

THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
02/16/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
2/17/94 :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the Eifro Medical Center which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Riode Zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Is satisfactory .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
COMPLICATIONS :
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg PO / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 PO q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. Riode Zetllille and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the Laelk Memorial Hospital .

Head CAT-scan :
No progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with PML .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / Cryptosporidiosis .
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
AZT was initiated .
Stool was negative for Cryptosporidium .
His diarrhea diminished .
He developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of Lomotil .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
As he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
2. Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma :
Coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma lesions , with almost total engulfing of his teeth .
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
3. Pancytopenia :
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .
He received one unit packed red blood cells .
4. Chronic VZV :
Biopsy of right lower extremity lesion showed VZV .
Acyclovir was initiated .
5. AIDS / disposition :
The patient &apos;s prognosis is very poor and was discussed with the patient and family .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to CTMC for further evaluation .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
None known .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Her husband is in a nursing home .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Skin :
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
Clear .
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
There was a soft right carotid and right femoral bruit .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
Bowel sounds present .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :
Showed nodes in both hands and crepitans of both knees .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
DISPOSITION :
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .
Discharge condition good .

SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy , 05/05/94 .
Gastrojejunostomy , 05/08/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 111y year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on 05/01 complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On 01/24 she was taken to the Rys Memorial Hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin daily .

She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her children in Co Darburg and is quite active .
She is originally from Tbalt .
She does not smoke and has rare alcohol intake .
FAMILY HISTORY :

Her mother died of an unspecified tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress .
Vital signs :
temperature 98.4 , blood pressure 116/60 , pulse 76 , respirations 18 .
HEENT :
sclerae anicteric , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements intact , oropharynx mildly dry .
The neck was supple with shotty lymphadenopathy , 2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiac :
regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Chest :
a few bibasilar crackles ; otherwise clear to auscultation .
Abdomen :
distended , bowel sounds present , tympanitic to percussion anteriorly , dull to percussion laterally .
No guarding or rebound .
Extremities :
no edema .
Breasts :
no masses , lesions or nipple discharge .
No axillary lymphadenopathy .
Neurological :
alert and oriented x 3 .
Cranial nerves II-XII intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count 13.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelet count 353,000 .
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Nakoloyd Knutzxelljesc is a fifty-one year old female who presented with metastatic lung cancer in July 1994 .
A work up at that time included a chest X-ray which showed a right hilar mass .
A chest computerized tomography scan showed a right hilar mass , extensive mediastinal adenopathy .
A bone scan showed lesions at T12 and T9 .
Abdominal CT scan showed normal adrenal .
Magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine revealed an erosive lesion at T12 and no cord compression .
A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma .
The patient was entered onto the ICE-T protocol and received three cycles of ICE-T.
After cycle two she had an MRI of the T-spine which showed some improvement in the disease .
After cycle three , she developed severe headache .
An MRI of the central nervous system was done and was unremarkable .
The pain her head became so severe she was admitted to E Health after cycle three with fever , neutropenia , headache , and a cellulitis on the left forearm possibly from an intravenous site .
She was discharged from the hospital on 11-04-94 with all of her problems under reasonable control except for her severe headache .
She called me on November 5 , which was one day later , with the headache becoming much worse and becoming disabling .
She , therefore , was admitted for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination revealed a middle aged woman with alopecia , and in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 100/60 , pulse of 70 , respirations of 20 , temperature was 98.6 .
Skin with alopecia , as noted .
HEENT examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The lungs were clear .
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs .
Breast exam with status post bilateral implants .
Belly was soft and nontender .
Extremities without edema .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
The white blood count was 9.8 , hematocrit was 29.1 , platelet count was 233,000 .
She had 58% polys , 21% bands , 7% lymphs , 7% monos .
The prothrombin time was 10.6 .
The BUN and creatinine was 13/0.7 , glucose 115 , amylase less than 30 , calcium 9.2 , phosphorus 4.9 , magnesium 1.7 , alkaline phosphatase 302 , SGOT 42 , LDH 360 , CPK 348 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Because of the severe headache , she was seen in consultation by Dr. Rashanemar Block and Dr. Riord R. Hall .
Dr. Rashanemar Block did a lumbar puncture which revealed an opening pressure of 27 , and her cytologies came back positive for adenocarcinoma .
She was seen in consultation by the Pain Service who placed her on a posterior communicating artery pump which helped her dramatically .
In addition , we obtained both cranial and neck MR which showed no evidence of any enhancement or epidural abscess .
When it was found that she had carcinomatous meningitis , she began interthecal methotrexate , given to her every three to four days by Dr. Hall .
This was well tolerated .
Her cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained greater than 35 cm of water for the first several days and because of this we decided to place an Ommaya reservoir .
The patient was seen in consultation by Radiation Therapy who did not feel that radiation at this point would offer any advantages .
She had a CSF flow study which showed normal flow CSF throughout her brain .
She had multiple episodes of seizures during the hospitalization and required therapy with Tegretol .
She was given some Mexiletine and Trazodone and did not tolerate that well .
Once she was on good anti-seizure medicine , she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures .
For the last several days of her hospitalization , we switched her over to a Duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of Duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control .
Her headache came under very nice control with aggressive Duragesic patch .
Access became a major problem and we had Dr. Anruchelle Chaffchird from Surgical Oncology place a double Port-a-cath without difficulty .
The plan with Knutzxelljesc will be to follow her very carefully .
She will be coming back to see us next Tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea .
For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well .
Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells .
For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult .
Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests .
The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline .
After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain .
She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy .
She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real .
Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed .
Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations .
Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses .
It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA .
She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour .
She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor .
Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis .
The patient &apos;s cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin .
She was , therefore , started on 7-15-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
She will continue on this until 7-25-91 .
Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication .
The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit .
She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on 7-17-92 .
She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well .
She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% .
Her chemotherapy was not started until 7-19-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile .
By 7-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy .
She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo .
She tolerated this chemotherapy well .
She will get biweekly laboratory results followed .
She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative .
DISPOSITION :
It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management .
Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s.

EPENDYMOMA INVOLVING THE CONUS MEDULLARIS OF THE SPINAL

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
1-26-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02-02-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Ependymoma involving the conus medullaris of the spinal cord .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
January 26 , 1994 , intradural microsurgical exploration and biopsy of invasive intramedullary conus tumor .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient is to rest .
He was given prescriptions for Decadron with a Decadron taper and he was given an out patient appointment to see Dr. Niste Addison in the Radiation Medicine Service to begin out patient radiotherapy .
He was told to have his sutures removed in seven to ten days , and told to call the office if problems or questions arose .
He was also given a prescription for Percocet as needed for pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This twenty-six year old male was admitted to the Ph University Of Medical Center on January 26 , 1994 to undergo surgical exploration of a conus tumor .
He had previously been evaluated for back pain and found to have a conus tumor on magnetic resonance imaging study .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Following the standard preoperative evaluation , he was taken to the operating room and underwent a laminectomy T11 , T12 , and L1 and intradural microsurgical exploration .
At the time of surgery we found an invasive conus tumor emanating from the ventral portio of the conus and completely engulfing and encircling all of the ventral nerve roots .
The procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring , and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles .
We felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them , that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit .
Therefore , the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The postoperative course was without complication .
Pain was managed initially with an intravenous patient controlled analgesia system .
The wound healed without difficulty and the drain was removed .
The patient began to ambulate .
His leg strength was noted to be identical to the way it had been prior to the surgery .
Because of his continued excellent progress , he was allowed to be discharged home on February 2 , 1994 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
(1) Hemoptysis .
(2) Metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone .
(3) Pancytopenia .
(4) Pain control .
(5) Chemotherapy-related dysuria .
(6) Chemotherapy-related tinnitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Shalyo Kaysplass is a 36-year-old male , with metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , admitted with shortness of breath , hemoptysis , and hip pain .
Mr. Kaysplass &apos;s history is well-documented in previous discharge summaries .
Basically , he was diagnosed in 1994 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone in his left hip , underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy , but was not a candidate for surgical resection and so underwent radiation therapy to the left hip .
He had metastases to the lungs , which responded to more chemotherapy and he underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in January , 1996 .
For the past six weeks prior to admission , the patient was complaining of worsening right hip pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy done to evaluate a new pancytopenia .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a mass growing out of the right sacrum , which could have been tumor or a hematoma .
Approximately a week before admission , repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlarging soft tissue mass consistent with tumor .
Chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules , which were thought , given the clinical situation , to be tumor .
The patient was set to undergo radiation therapy to the mass in the right hip when he called complaining of fatigue , dyspnea on exertion , and persistent hip pain .
He also complained of fever .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Shalyo Kaysplass is an obese man in mild respiratory distress .
His oxygen saturation was 85% on room air .
His chest had diffuse rales .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm , although rapid .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient responded to oxygen , however , his pain in his hip was severe and required Morphine drip .
His hemoptysis did not improve and his platelet count was quite low .
Due to intermittent bouts of shortness of breath , and the understanding that he had a widely-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , he was made a do not resuscitate , and on the fifth hospital day , the patient expired .

The patient is a 101-year-old man with a history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy who presents with weight gain and some shortness of breath .
The patient has a long history of coronary disease starting in 1946 with his first myocardial infarction .
He underwent a CABG for four vessels in 1980 and did well until 1992 when he began to experience episodic chest pain .
He continued to have episodes of angina for the subsequent several years .
He subsequently went to cath in 1994 which showed a native three vessel disease , patent saphenous vein grafts to his diagonal and to his obtuse marginal and diffusely diseased saphenous vein grafts to his RCA .
He had an echo at this time which showed an ejection fraction of 20% with inferolateral akinesis , septal akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis of the LV .
He had severe mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation at this time .
He subsequently has been managed at a nursing home medically .
He had been doing fairly well on PO medications and has had intermittent admissions for dobutamine holidays with IV diuresis .
The last of such admissions took place in 1997 in July when he was admitted and placed on dobutamine and diuresed to a dry weight of 115 pounds .
He now presents with at least 10 pound weight gain in spite of doses of increasing diuretics .
He also has been complaining of abdominal bloating and reports increased size of his abdomen .
He denies any fevers , chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain and only mild shortness of breath .

His blood pressure was 98/60 .
His heart rate was 75 .
Respirations of 12 and he was afebrile .
HEENT is notable for extraocular movements being intact , for equal round and reactive pupils and for a clear oropharynx .
Neck :
His JVP was up to his angle of his jaw .
He had soft bilateral bruits versus a trasmissable murmur in his neck .
Lungs :
He had crackles a third of the way up at the bases with poor air movement .
Cardiovascular :
He had an irregularly irregular S1 and S2 with a Grade III / VI holosystolic murmur at the apex and a Grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the base with mild radiation to this carotids bilaterally .
He had a positive hepatojugular reflux .
Abdomen :
He had positive bowel sounds .
It was soft .
It was mildly distended with a fluid wave and shifting dullness .
Extremities had 1+ non-pitting pedal edema bilaterally and diffuse ecchymoses and thinned skin .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 139 , potassium of 3.2 , chloride of 96 , bicarb of 32.1 , BUN of 79 , creatinine of 3.4 , glucose of 129 , magnesium of 2.2 and albumin of 3.2 , bilirubins of .4/.9 , alkaline phosphatase of 126 , SGOT of 27 , hematocrit of 27.6 , white count of 4.7 , PT of 13.4 , PTT of 26.5 .
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation versus frequent PVC &apos;s and no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ischemia .
His chest x-ray showed mild cephalization of vessels but no evidence of overwhelming congestive heart failure and no air space disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted and placed on IV dobutamine and also IV Lasix for diuresis .
He was also placed on varying vasodilator regimens .
It was thought that his Hydralazine had caused a drug induced lupus .
Initially , he was changed to Cozaar .
His creatinine then began to increase at this time and the patient became hypotensive .
He was then started on amlodipine up to 10 mg. PO QD with more stable blood pressure .
A few days prior to discharge , he was also begun back on his prazosin and currently is at 2 mg. PO QD .
He was aggressively diuresed with a goal dry weight of 121 pounds .
At the time of discharge , he was down to 123 pounds .
This is approximately 10 pounds less than his admission weight .
His dobutamine was discontinued approximately 2 days prior to discharge .
He continued to have a good urine output to a regimen of PO diuresis including Bumex 4 mg. PO BID , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID and Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID .
2. Renal :
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency .
With optimization of his cardiac output and volume status , his creatinine improved to his baseline of 2.0 .
He continues to have approximately 500-700 cc. of urine output every eight hours .
He is fluid restricted to 1 liter of free water .
He should also follow a strict diet including 2 gram salt restriction per day .
3. GU :
The patient has had a Foley in place for several months for urinary retention and BPH .
He has failed a trial of Hydrin after discontinuation of his Foley .
Urology felt that this time that the only other option would be a suprapubic tube which would not decrease the risk of infection .
In consultation with the patient , it was decided to leave the Foley in place and to place him on daily Cipro for UTI prophylaxis .
4. Hematologic :
The patient has mild baseline pancytopenia .
He occasionally has a transfusion .
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells the day before discharge for a hematocrit of 25 .
His hematocrit at the time of discharge is 30 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is now discharged stably with a weight of 123 pounds to Lupe Frankcinevirg Asma Ein Health Care for further management .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Gentamicin ointment to the left eye QHS , Ativan .5 mg. PO TID , Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID , Colace 100 mg. PO TID , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg. PO QD , amlodipine 10 mg. PO QD , Mevacor 20 mg. PO QD , Nitro-patch .6 mg. per hour once a day , digoxin .125 mg. PO QD , iron sulfate 325 mg. PO TID , Cardura 2 mg. PO QHS , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID , and Bumex 4 mg. PO BID .

(3) Mycelex Troches three times a day ;
(4) Prednisone , 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. ;
(5) Cimetidine , 300 mg. at bedtime .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 40-year-old , right-handed , white male with a Grade III glioma of the cerebellum originally diagnosed in 07/96 .
He was treated at that time with subtotal resection followed by radiation to the lesion .
He had been maintained on low-dose steroid for most of the last 1 years because of increasing symptoms when the medication was tapered .
He was referred to Neuro Oncology Clinic on 11/28/96 with complaints of choking on liquids , increasing facial weakness and imbalance .
He also had reported progressive fatigue and weakness with an inability to arise from a sitting position without the use of his hands .
He had recently had a fall and had to crawl back to his vehicle because of an inability to right himself .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination in the office he was obviously cushingoid with a protuberant abdomen and cachectic arms and legs .
His neck was supple with no spinal tenderness .
There was a complete left seventh nerve palsy .
There was horizontal nystagmus on right and left gaze and some beats of vertical nystagmus when looking up or down .
There was 4/5 neck flexor , bilateral deltoid and iliopsoas weakness with wasting of the quadriceps musculature .
His distal strength was relatively preserved .
Sensation to touch was preserved .
There was normal appendicular coordination but obvious truncal ataxia with a widening of his base and an inability to tandem .
On general examination it was also noted that he had oral thrush as well as multiple subcutaneous firm but mobile nodules .
An MRI from 11/96 compared to his most recent MRI demonstrated residual enhancing mass near the roof of the left fourth ventricle as well as obvious ependymal enhancement in the frontal horns , body and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles .
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma with ependymal spread .
There was also great concern that he had developed cranial neuropathy and was choking and aspirating .
There was also obvious steroid toxicity .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by the Speech Pathology Service who identified a mild dysarthria and oral dysphagia .
It was not felt that he was significantly aspirating and a modified barium swallow was not necessary .
He underwent a lumbar puncture on 11/29/96 which was traumatic , showing 58,000 red blood cells and increased protein .
An ample specimen was sent for cytological analysis .
He also was treated with Nystatin and Mycelex for his oral thrush and his Dexamethasone was changed to Prednisone in an effort to improve the weakness due to his steroid myopathy .
He was also given Lacri-Lube for the left eye as it was not fully closing due to his facial palsy .
The patient was discharged on 11/30/96 back to his home in Sastonton-mont , Ohio .
He will be enrolled in an experimental chemotherapy protocol for recurrent malignant glioma .
The case will be discussed at Brain Tumor Conference on 12/03/96 .
He will also start a physical therapy program for the steroid myopathy once he is back in Sler .

Abdominal aortic aneurysm was discovered on examination and patient was referred to Retelk County Medical Center .
He was admitted on 10/17/06 and echocardiogram done on 11/13/09 revealed poor left ventricular function and cardiac catheterization was done on admission which showed three vessel disease .
Patient was referred to Cardiology and underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 11/25/09 .
His post-operative course was complicated by an E. coli urinary tract infection and transient acute renal failure with increasing creatinine .
Patient &apos;s renal function returned to normal over several days , however .
The patient &apos;s last ultrasound of his aorta revealed a l0 cm aneurysm and he presented at the time of admission for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
Myocardial infarction also in l983 and l988 , congestive heart failure in l989 , diverticulitis in l978 , and spontaneous pneumothorax in l956 .
He had a coronary artery bypass graft times three as mentioned above .

He is allergic to Penicillin , Inderal , and also to Procan .
Patient has a seventy pack year history of smoking which he quit ten years ago and he has previously had problems with alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission was remarkable for an abdomen which was soft and non-tender .
There was a pulsatile mass felt in the right upper quadrant near the midline .
He had dopplerable lower extremity pulses on the left and on the right , they were palpable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12/24/09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
In his post-operative course , patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin .
Post-operatively , patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats .
His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload .
There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle .
Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose .
Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine .
Patient was discharged from the unit on 12/30/09 and was sent to the floor .
His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down .
Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge .
Patient also was found to have elevated LDH , alkaline phosphatase , and amylase prior to admission .
Lipase was within normal limits .
Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities .
Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .
Serial EKG and CK were obtained which were negative .
A chest X-Ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema .
An arterial blood gas at that time showed pO2 of 68 , saturation of 95% , a pH of 7.5l , pCO2 of 37 , a bicarbonate of 37 , and a pCO2 of 3l with a +7 base .

PROSTATE CANCER AND RENAL FAILURE
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
03/03/1999
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
03/08/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1. METASTATIC PROSTATE CA .
2. OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY , STATUS POST LEFT NEPHROSTOMY .
3. HYPERTENSION .
4. ANEMIA .
5. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE .
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
This 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .
No cough .
No chest pain .
No palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .
No headache .
No bone pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Hypertension .
2) Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
3) Anemia .
4) Prostate CA .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .
He was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .
He is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .
Temperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air .

Chest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base .
Heart initially tachycardia , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .
Abdomen :
Soft .
Liver and spleen were not palpable .
Bowel sounds normoactive .
Extremities :
Traced pitting edema .
No cyanosis and no clubbing .
Peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .
No calf tenderness .
Homan &apos;s sign negative .
Neurologic :
Examination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .
Liver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .
CBC :
WBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .
PT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .
No lung infiltrate .
CT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .
A mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .
The CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .
CK enzymes 146 .
Repeated three times and remained flat .
Troponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
The patient is a 79 year old woman who was admitted following a two day history of shaking chills and fever .
One week prior to admission , she developed dysuria which resolved and she remained well until two days prior to admission when she began to develop shaking chills and a sense of tightness in her throat which she was previously treated with nitroglycerin and it was presumed to be an anginal equivalent .
Her symptoms continued and on the night of admission , she took three nitroglycerin tablets sublingual before relief , but because of the fever and chills , she came to the emergency room where she was found to have a temperature of 102 and microscopic pyuria .
She was admitted with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection .

She appeared comfortably , although had a temperature of l01 .
The blood pressure was l26/65 .
Respirations 20 and pulse 76 and regular .
Her neck was supple and there was no neck vein distension .
Her lungs were clear with an occasional rales at the bases .
Her heart was normal except fora Grade II / VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border radiating to the carotids .

The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems and known transfusion dependent secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome admitted with decreased hematocrit .
The patient has had multiple previous admissions for cardiac and pulmonary disease .
He has had chronic anemia since 1990 , but a bone marrow biopsy in 07-92 , was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome .
Over the past several months , the patient has had increasing transfusing requirements .
His transfusions have been complicated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure , secondary to ischemia cardiomyopathy .
His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue .
His wife says his hands and lips have been blue .
Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time .
Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough .
He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis .
The patient did report taking a po antibiotic ( Ciprofloxacin ) for right great toe infection ( question of cellulitis vs. paronychia ) .

HEENT :
Bilateral cataracts ; neck appeared to be somewhat asymmetric thyroid with small nodule barely palpable on the left lobe with the thyroid , otherwise negative .
No lymphadenopathy was palpated .
Lungs :
Rales 1/3 of the way upbilaterally .
Cardiovascular examination revealed jugular venous distention at 12 cm , no carotid bruits , heart rate was tachycardic and regular , normal S1 and S2 , palpable S4 , no murmur was auscultated .
Abdominal examination :
Obese , soft , non-tender , bowel sounds were present .
Rectal examination :
Heme negative .
Extremities :
Joint deformities consistent with rheumatoid arthritis , right MTP / toe with minimal erythema .
Skin examination :
Diffuse psoriasis over trunk and arms .
Neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
SMA-7 was unremarkable aside form a creatinine of 1.6 and a glucose of 207 ; otherwise , was within normal limits .
Hematocrit was 22.4 ; white count .59 ; platelets 84.
The patient had an absolute neutropenia with a ANC of 318 ; differential revealed 48 segs , 6 bands , 40 lymphs , 4 monos .
Digoxin level was 1.4 .
Theo-Dur level was 15 .
PT was 12.5 ; PTT 27.0 .
Urinalysis was within normal limits .
Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .
EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter .

Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .

He had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .
Abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .
He had 2+ carotids , no bruits .
He had gynecomastia .
Rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .
Extremities :
1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .
He had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .
His right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.
His hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .
Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .
His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .
He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .
Mental state :
He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ( BASELINE CREATININE 1.5-1.8 ) , PROSTATE CANCER , HYPERTENSION , GOUT , EOSINOPHILIA , HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA , GI BLEED IN 1988 , HISTORY OF ALCOHOL ABUSE , DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE , HISTORY OF STRONG YLOIDES .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 96-year-old man with coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure ( ejection fraction 20% ) , chronic renal insufficiency , admitted with fatigue , generalized weakness and failure to thrive .
He has had four brief admissions to Angelesshoresterpre Anret&apos;ssanmi Memorial Hospital for mild congestive heart failure this year .
His most recent admission was from 9/23 - 06/00 at which time he presented with shaking chills , weakness in legs and SSCP .
He ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin of 7 , but flat CKs and no EKG changes .
The decision was made not to be aggressive with his treatment since the patient is DNR / DNI .
He was discharged to Linghs County Medical Center on 9/25/99 and returned to Angelesshoresterpre Anret&apos;ssanmi Memorial Hospital on 9/29/99 with generalized weakness , poor appetite and \ &quot; feeling lousy\ &quot; .
He had no chest pain , shortness of breath or abdominal pain .
He was very anxious and reported that he had not had much sleep in the past week at Raburging Health and felt very tired from all the physical therapy that he had been undergoing .
In the Emergency Department , he had good oxygen saturations with a CK of 50 , troponin I 0.81 and an EKG without acute changes .
He was admitted to be ruled out for an myocardial infarction and to be worked up for his weakness .
Over the course of his hospital stay , he had multiple episodes of chest pain which were relieved with multiple doses of sublingual nitroglycerin and IV Morphine .
He had no acute EKG changes during any of these episodes of chest pain .
The decision was made by Dr. Obestimeuph and the family to keep the patient comfortable with Morphine during episodes of chest pain and to otherwise remain nonaggressive ( no Intensive Care Unit , no cardiac catheterization ) .

ADMISSION DATE :
09/27/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
10/04/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic breast cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Dehydration , generalized anxiety disorder .
HISTORY AND REASONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This 75-year-old woman presented on week prior to admission with nausea .
An enlarged liver was noted and ultrasound and CT scan showed multiple probable metastatic lesions .
She presented on the day of admission with nausea and weakness and was admitted for observation and coordination of treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a weak , elderly woman in a wheel chair who could not walk without assistance .
Blood pressure 140/90 , pulse 80 , no cervical , supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy .
On the breasts , multiple , erythematous , scaly plaques with underlying induration and inversion of the nipple on the right , left breast without masses .
Abdomen :
Liver span 12 cm firm with mild , right upper quadrant tenderness .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Included a hematocrit of 41 , a white of 10,500 , platelets of 298 , alkaline phosphatase of 162 , potassium of 3.3 and remaining liver function tests and electrolytes normal .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without abnormalities .
Chest x-ray was clear .
RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was begun on intravenous hydration shortly after admission because of very poor PO fluid intake .
Diagnostic work up included a fine needle aspiration of her right breast lesion which revealed ductal carcinoma , with estrogen and progesterone receptor status pending at the time of discharge .
She had a bone scan which showed multiple areas of increased uptake , particularly in L1 , L3 and L4 , as well as the left sixth posterior rib .
This corresponded to a site of pain reported by the patient .
Her abdominal CT scan showed multiple lesions in the liver with enlarged periportal lymph nodes , cholelithiasis , and a left adrenal mass thought to likely represent metastatic disease .
During her hospitalization , the main issues were pain control and nausea .
Her pain was ultimately helped most by a regimen of oxycodone and oxycontin , and nausea responded to p.r.n. Trilafon .
She was somewhat sedated on this regimen , and her standing Serax dose was reduced with substitution of Klonopin .
She was seen by Radiation Medicine for palliative XRT to the painful lesions in her LS spine , and radiation therapy was begun on 10/2/97 with the plan for approximately 10 daily treatments .
She required considerable encouragement to maintain PO intake , and required intravenous hydration to achieve adequate fluid intake during her hospitalization .
A Physical Therapy evaluation could not be completed because of her degree of pain and nausea .
She is being discharged to Linghs County Medical Center , with plans for continuing her tamoxifen pending estrogen receptor status availability which should be available within the coming week .
She will also continue x-ray therapy treatment and being physical therapy as tolerated .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
SEPSIS .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1 ) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED .
2 ) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY .
3 ) END STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vinktlandfreierm was admitted from Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. Erm Neidwierst , was notified as well .

Barium Enema showed diverticula .
He was doing well on the Surgical Service until 04/08/93 when he experienced the acute onset of dyspnea and desaturation .
He was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He ruled in for myocardial infarction by EKG and enzyme criteria .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit , his do not resuscitate status was clarified by his legal guardian .
It was Mr. Fyfeguayfalc &apos;s wish to not be resuscitated , no intubation , no pressors , and no defibrillation .
He was extubated on the evening of 04/08/93 and was transferred to Loui Dingspar Chepidster Medical Center the morning of 04/09/93 .

He became tachypneic and confused with labored breathing and a respiratory rate in the thirties .
He was placed on 100% non-rebreather with O2 saturation of 79% .
Blood pressure was 172/70 .
He was given one sublingual Nifedipine , a total of 4 mg of Morphine , and 20 mg of Lasix without significant result .
Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19 , pCO2 74 , pO2 50 , and O2 saturation of 73% .
Chest X-Ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate which was new , a left lower lobe infiltrate , and no edema .
Lungs had scattered rhonchi with little air movement .
He was suctioned with return of food particles , presumed aspiration .
His O2 saturation remained in the sixties to seventies despite repeated nebulizers and suctioning .

2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .

Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Bath is a 77-year-old retired psychologist who was admitted because of a fall .
He has a history of failing memory and difficulty with gait , dating back to 1993 when he had a cat scan which was said to be unremarkable , however , over the past year he has progressively deteriorated in terms of his memory and mental function and over the past six months has rapidly deterioratedwith his gait so that it has recently been very difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk unassisted .
Finally , he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up .
A nursing assessment thought that it was unsafe for the patient to be at home so he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
there was no evidence of serious trauma .
His general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 ; pulse of 72 and regular .
He was in no acute distress .
His neck was supple .
The chest was normal .
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted .
The carotids were normal .
There were no bruits .
There was some paravertebral tenderness over the lumbar sign but this was not severe .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and slightly distended but bowel sounds were present .
There were no masses noted .
The Extremities examination revealed no edema .
Pulses were palpable .
The neurological evaluation revealed that the patient spoke with slow speech with a paucity of expression and monotonal quality .
He was attentive and concentrate but did not perform serial addition or subtraction normally , although it was fair .
He was oriented as to the date and place and some historical details were maintained .
He was unable to ambulate without assistance .
His tone was cog wheeling in the upper extremities and there was a lead pipe type rigidity in the lower extremities .
There were also a few myoclonic jerks .
He also had some frontal lobe signs .
LABORATORY DATA :
upon admission included electrolytes which were normal .
BUN and creatinine were 17 and 1.0 ; digoxin level of .8 ; sugar of 154 ; white blood count of 7.4 ; platelet count of 180,000 ; hematocrit level of 35% .
The electrocardiogram demonstrated an old right bundle branch block , otherwise normal .
The head cat scan was negative .
The lumbar spine films showed an old L-9 compression fracture which was confirmed on cat scanning .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Doll Grendbly from the Neurology Service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had Parkinson &apos;s Disease with certainly some Parkinsonian features to his picture .
However , some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that .
There was also a question of Alzheimer &apos;s Disease to explain his dementia .
Dr. Block recommended a trial of Sinemet therapy which was begun in the hospital and he was then transferred to are habilitation hospital for vigorous physical therapy and further evaluation of his Sinemet trial .
He will be followed closely in the out-patient department by both Dr. Block and his primary care physician , Dr. Curling .

He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Associated medical problems include :
1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .
2. Anxiety .
3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .
4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .
2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .
4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day .
6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day .
7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress .
He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .
He was in moderate respiratory distress .
His temperature was 98F .
He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .
Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .
Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .
There were no wheezes or rhonchi .
Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .
Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .
Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .
Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .
He moved all extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .
Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .
Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable .
I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .
He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .
3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .
4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .
5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 .
6. Lasix 40 mg per day .
7. Prednisone 40 mg per day to be tapered over two weeks .
8. Xalatan eyedrops 1 gtt in left eye per day .
9. Alphagan 1 gtt in left eye three times a day .
10. Trusopt 1gtt in left eye three times a day .
11. Prilosec 20 mg per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient should have follow up with his primary care physician Dr. Rod Linkeboltshieltrus at the TRE 453 about one week after discharge from rehab facility .
The telephone number at his office is 236-4518 .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
KOTE , LYFRANKLAPALM
UNIT NUMBER :
512-13-39
ADMISSION DATE :
01/18/2001
DISCHARGE DATE :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. Riode Area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .
The patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .
He had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .
He also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .
He was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .
The patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. Area &apos;s office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .
He has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .
He had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
His medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .
His Coumadin has been held for two days .
His claudication is equal bilaterally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .
His rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the Tocon Hospital the previous week .
He has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .
His pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .
LABORATORY DATA :
His BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .
He has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .
After discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .
EP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .
There was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .
Superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .
There was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .
The profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .
It was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .
The patient postoperatively did quite well .
He had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .
His groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .
Because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .
The orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to Frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly .
No cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .
Despite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .
I had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .
I explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .

ASSESSMENT :
This is a 74 year old woman with a vague poorly defined history of coronary disease and EKGs and history consistent with previous myocardial infarction who now presents hypertension , tachycardia , nausea and chest tightness with EKG changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Hospital course by system :
1. CARDIAC :
The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .
She was placed on Nitropaste .
She was given Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
She was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .
Her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with CKs of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , She was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on 7/31/96 which showed an EF of 35% .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .
A diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .
There was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .
The estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .
Given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ACE inhibitor , Captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .
This was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .
She also underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test on 8/1/96 which showed nondiagnostic EKG response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .
She will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
Given her recent start on an ACE inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , BUN and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ACE inhibitor .
Given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .
However , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of Lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .
She will not be transferred on Lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .
NEUROLOGY :
From a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .
She was initially managed with prn Haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including Depakote , Prozac , Klonopin and Trilafon .
She gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .
However , she does express frequent need for attention .
She appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .
In talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .
3. HYPERTENSION :
From the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on Nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ACE inhibitor as mentioned above .
The Nifedipine was discontinued on 8/1/96 in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .
Her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .
ORTHOPEDICS :
She did have right knee pain and swelling .
She underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .
Her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
She will be followed by Dr. Nelson who follows her at the Montden Hospital .
She will be transferred on 8/2/96 in good condition .
Transfer Medications :
Metropolol 25 mg po bid , Captopril 25 mg po tid , Depakote 250 mg po qid , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd , Colace 100 mg potid , Prozac 20 mg po qd , Clonipine .5 mg po qhs , Trilifon 2 mg po bid and Darvocet 1 tab po q6h prn for pain .
Her diet should be low cholesterol and low sodium diet and she will followup as above .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
acute renal insufficiency .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.
Family and primary carephysician informed .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year old male who came to the emergency room with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia .
The patient has a history of previous appendectomy with an incision that went down into this same area .
The hernia could not be reduced in the emergency room .
The patient was admitted to the hospital therefore .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , there was a tender mass in the right groin .
The physical examination was otherwise noncontributory .
LABORATORY DATA :
Noncontributory .
HOSPITAL COURSE :

His discharge hematocrit is approximately 25.8 .
He has been restarted on his regimen of diuretics including Aldactone and Lasix .
The patient was noted to be fairly hypotensive throughout his hospitalization despite aggressive fluid resuscitation .
This is believed to be secondary to his Inderal dose .
Subsequently his beta blocker dose was decreased to 5 mg po qid and his discharge blood pressure is approximately 95/45 .
Additionally his potassium dose was decreased to 20 qd for his admission potassium of 4.8 .
He is continued on his Ofloxacin prophylaxis for SBP throughout his hospitalization and will be discharged home on this as well .
Notably while the patient has a small pleural effusion , he does not have any evidence of ascites at this time .
The patient continues to be a candidate for possible liver transplant and his evaluation for placement on the transplant list is still in progress .
The patient is awaiting a final evaluation from Dr. Sintnieves of the Addiction Services Team .
He was in Dr. Sintnieves &apos;s office at the time of his hematemesis on the day of admission and was seen again by Dr. Sintnieves while hospitalized .
He has been told to follow up with Dr. Sintnieves again after discharge .
Again , the patient is quite adamant that he wished to pursue liver transplant and will follow through with all physician recommendations as needed to insure his candidacy .
Notably , the patient did not develop any encephalopathic signs post TIPS procedure , however he was started on Lactulose to prevent any mild mental status changes .

HEPATIC METASTASES FROM COLON CANCER .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
7-28-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
7-29-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatic metastases from colon cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Colon cancer ,
2. disseminated intravascular coagulopathy .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. On 7-28-94 , right trisegmentectomy ( hepatic resection ) .
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES :
1. On 7-29-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,
2. on 7-29-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to Dr. Duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .
The patient initially presented in September of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .
She subsequently underwent a right colectomy in September of 1992 for a Duke &apos;s C-II moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .
She subsequently recent adjuvant 5-FU and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in September of 1993 .
In Thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .
Postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in February of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in April of 1994 .
A computerized tomography scan obtained in April of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .
After two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .
The computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .
Prior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .
These demonstrated
1. portal vein patent ,
2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,
3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .
The patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .
The operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .
The left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .
The intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .
The patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .
There were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .
The patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .
The decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .
The patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .
The operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .
The patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .
The patient required blood pressure support with pressors .
Due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .
The patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .
The abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .
The patient continued to require transfusions .
The patient &apos;s oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .
The ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .
The urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .
As the patient &apos;s hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .
The study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .
Despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94 .
At this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient expired .

HISTORY OF PRESEnt ILLNESS :
The patient is a 67 year old white male with ahistory of a heart murmur .
In September of 1996 his wife noted increasing episodes of forgetfulness .
A work up was instituted which revealed a head CT which showed changes consistent with age .
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on 12/6/96 which revealed clean coronary arteries with a band-like obstruction of the origin of the right coronary artery from 3+ aortic insufficiency .
There was a dilated aortic aneurysm including the sinus and ascending aorta .
The patient therefore presents with composite aortic root replacement .
He underwent an abdominal ultrasound which showed a dilated aorta distally , measuring 2.6 x 3 cm .

His pulses are 2+ bilaterally throughout .
IMPRESSION ;
A 67 year old white male with increasing mental status changes who was found to have an aortic root aneurysm upon work up .
He is scheduled to undergo a composite aortic root replacement .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on 12/11/96 .
He was seen by the dental service preoperatively who cleared him for surgery , as he had no evidence of acute oral infection .
On 12/12/96 the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent a composite aortic root replacement .
postoperatively , he was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
he was given Vancomycin IV for perioperative prophylactic antibiotics .
By postoperative day 1 he was extubated and was stable enough for discharge to the regular floor .
He was placed on Coumadin postoperatively as well as digoxin and Lopressor .
His mental status changes remained stable from their perioperative baseline and he was continued on his Haldol .
He was in atrial fibrillation postoperatively but his rate was well controlled on digoxin and Lopressor .
His chest tubes were all removed by postoperative day 3 .
He was placed on Coumadin given the presence of the persistent atrial fibrillation and it is thought that he would only need short term anticoagulation for approximately 3 months .
By postoperative day 7 the patient was stable enough for discharge to home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will follow up at the anti-coagulation clinic for his Coumadin follow up .
He will follow up with Dr. Rhalt and Dr. Em .
He will be visited by home Sini Memorial Hospital services .
His medications on discharge include digoxin 0.375 mg PO QD , Lopressor 75 mg PO BID , Coumadin to attain an INR of 1.8 to 2 , Haldol 0.5 mg Po BID and Prednisolone 0.12% OU QD .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE .
OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES :
FEMOROPOPLITEAL BYPASS ON 06-28-90 , BY DR. RISHAN THOREGORB .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is well known to the Chief Service and was recently discharged on 06-13-90 .
Her original admission was for an ischemic left foot .
History reveals a 72 year old woman with multiple medical problems including chronic atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , polyarticular gouty arthritis , who is confined to a wheelchair .
She has peripheral vascular disease and ischemic left foot , for which she was admitted and underwent angiography and angioplasty on her previous admission , which was from 6-6-90 to 06-13-90 .
She had angioplasty of her left external iliac and proximal distal superficial femoral artery .
She returns for a progressively ischemic left foot .
She was admitted to the Service on 06-25-90 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include .0675 of digoxin a day , prednisone 15 milligrams per day , Capoten 6.25 milligrams a day , Pepcid 20milligrams a day , cardizem 90 milligrams each morning .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her examination is remarkable for a Cushingoid-appearing woman in no acute distress with multiple ecchymoses over her body .
She has obvious deformities of her joints from her arthritic condition .
She has brisk upstrokes in the carotids without any bruits .
Lungs are clear .
Heart has normal rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
She has a colostomy on the left side that is healthy .
Extremities are remarkable for deformities secondary to arthritis with a swan deformity of her fingers .
Her pulses are carotids II+ bilaterally , radial pulses II+ bilaterally , right leg has II+ femoral , I+ dorsalis pedis and I+ posterior tibialis .
On the left side , she has no pulses below her femoral pulses .
On her left foot , her first , third and fourth toes are black with gangrene and there is an area of hyperemia just proximal to that .
She also has a ulcer on the left heel .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , laboratory data were unremarkable and within normal limits , except for creatinine 1.6. Hematocrit on admission was 34.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and had preoperative evaluation .
She was taken to the operating room on 06-27-90 , and underwent a left femoral to below-the-knee popliteal in situ graft using the saphenous vein .
The patient underwent the procedure without any complications and returned to her room .
Her hospital course was unremarkable .
Of note is the fact that her left leg was quite edematous postoperatively , likely due to the fact that her lymphatic system was interrupted and she had likely a venous thrombosis which is old in the left deep veins .
Her wound weeped serosanguinous fluid and was treated with dressing changes .
By the time of her discharge , her wound was significantly drier and she went home with dry sterile dressing changes only toher groin area .
She went home with staples intact due to the fact that she has poor wound healing secondary to chronic steroid use .
The patient had a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse her entire hospitalization and her foot was warm .
There always remained asmall area of erythema in her forefoot , however , this was markedly improved .
Her gangrene stayed dry the whole time and she wastreated with 5 days of triple antibiotics .
During the hospitalization , the patient did develop a small flare in herarthritis , for which her rheumatologist was consulted and they increased her steroids for approximately 3 days .
The patient did well .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home , to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Thoregorb .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include digoxin .0625 a day , prednisone 50 milligrams a day , cardizem 30 milligrams 3 times a day , K-Dur 20 milligrams a day .
The patient has her own visiting nurse and she will see to any wound care .

Pulses are :
radial-left trace , right 2+ ; brachial-left 1+ , right 2+ ; femoral 2+ bilaterally ; popliteal 2+ bilaterally ; dorsalispedis 2+ bilaterally ; posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally .
ASSESSMENT :
Complicated patient who has continued smoking for her extensive peripheral vascular disease history .
She now has possibly quit cigarettes , but has renewed symptoms of right carotid disease .
She is to undergo an angiogram when her coagulation profile allows .
She has been on Coumadin .
We will check her coags before heparinizing , and she will go to angiography when her prothrombin time comes within an acceptable range .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was seen by Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles of Cardiology who recommended that , if she were to undergo an operative procedure , that she first have a coronary perfusion scan .
The patient was also seen by Dr. Breutz of the GI Service who assessed her as not needing colonoscopy or a GI series at this time .
She was also seen by the Stroke Service who noted that a recent magnetic resonance angiogram had reportedly shown a right common carotid artery occlusion .
They also noted that a careful elicitation of her visual symptoms seemed possibly consistent more with migraine than with ischemia .
They recommended that she have a baseline head computerized tomographyscan , agreed with obtaining an angiogram and recommended trying a trial of migraine therapy to see if ocular symptoms resolved .
Meanwhile the patient was heparinized .
Her prothrombin time came down and , on 11/15/96 , she underwent angiography .
This showed :
1. a patent aorto innominate left common carotid graft .
2. an occluded right common carotid artery , right internal carotid and reconstitution of a short segment of right external carotid from the left vertebral .
3. a mild stenosis of the right proximal subclavian artery .
4. mild stenosis of the right vertebral origin .
5. apatent left common carotid , left internal carotid , status post left carotid endarterectomy .
6. an occluded left external carotid .
7. a patent left subclavian proximally , occluded left axillary artery with reconstitution ofthe left brachial artery .
8. moderate to severe stenosis of the left vertebral origin .
9. right cerebral hemisphere fills from the left vertebral and the left internal carotid .
Given these angiographic findings , which were not amenable to surgery , the patient was weaned from heparin , restarted on Coumadin , and was discharged today , 11/18/96 , with therapeutic protime .
In retrospect , her symptoms may have been surrounding the final thrombosis of her right carotid .
A perfusion scan was not necessary as no surgical procedure was entertained .
An I-head computerized tomography scan done on 11/16/96 showed two areas of old infarction without evidence of a recent infarct or bleed .
Both the old infarcts were in the right hemisphere , # 1 in the frontal lobe nad # 2 around the centrum semi ovale .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was discharged home in good condition .
FOLLOW UP :
She will follow up with her local doctor &apos;s Coumadin clinic .

Heart rate was 78 , blood pressure 98/50 , respiratory rate of 32 , satting 91% on four liters .
In general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .
HEENT - normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation .
Chest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .

The patient was a 52-year-old woman who was diagnosed with metastatic high-grade leiomyosarcoma in 1995 and had undergone extensive treatments including multiple laser chemotherapy , pulmonary wedge resections , and brain surgeries .
She had recently completed a cycle of gemcitabine and Taxotere .
Her primary oncologist felt that she was end-stage , but the patient and her family were questioning for additional treatment .
She was seen at Carmoaksfearwhit Hospital for regular follow up to check her cell counts .
She was found at that time to have possible cellulitis and was admitted for this as well as out of concern that she had had many falls at home and did not have services .
The patient reported noticing redness on her left hand incidentally the morning of admission and denied any fevers or cuts .
The hand was nontender .
Her most recent fall was the day prior to admission , and she did not hit her head .

A chronically ill-appearing , pale woman with mild dyspnea , speaking in full sentences .
Oropharynx is without petechiae or evidence of bleeding .
She did have mild thrush , no exudate , no lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular Exam :
Regular rate and rhythm , 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal base without aeration .
Lung exam revealed diffuse breast sounds over the left lower lobe as well as left upper lobe .
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds , soft , no hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 2+ distal pulses .
There was 2+ , nonpitting edema in the left foot .
Back revealed no spinal tenderness .

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
She was initially given Ancef IV .
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
Her blood gas at that time was PH 7.26 , bicarb 93 , oxygen 70 , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
There was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
She was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
She was started on nasal BiPAP and repeat arterial blood gas on the BiPAP was PH 7.26 , PCO2 1.11 , and PO2 157 .
Her code status was visited with her family .
They felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. Respiratory :
The patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her PCO2 .
This was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved PH 7.49 , PCO2 58 , and PO2 242 .
She had abronchoscopy on 09/18/2004 which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
The patient self-extubated on 09/20/2004 and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient required neosynephrine throughout her intensive care unit stay .
This was continued until 09/24/2004 at which time her family decided to withdraw pressers .
3. Comfort :
The patient was agitated and uncomfortable throughout much of her intensive care unit stay .
It was difficult to both keep her comfortable and maintain adequate respiratory drive .
Her pulmonary status gradually worsened throughout her intensive care stay after her self-extubation on 09/20/2004 .
Reintubation was not desired by the patient or the family .
Her code status was DNR .
She developed rattling in her trachea audible without a stethoscope on 09/24/2004 , was poorly arousable , and had a venous PCO2 of 103 .
She was more awake that afternoon , was able to interact somewhat with her family .
However , in light of her suffering and terminal condition , her family elected to discontinue the use of neosynephrine .
The patient died on 09/25/2004 at 12:49 a.m.
Death was pronounced by Dr. Ilon Cale .
The family was offered and declined a postmortem examination .
Prior to her death , she had been comfortable on the Morphine drip .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .

( 2 ) diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
1/25/94 :
Urgent right carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass graft .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white female who was transferred from Oneoremadi Ryviewmawpa Greecounbci with severe coronary artery disease and presented for coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient overall had been in her usual state of good health until three to four months prior when she developed progressively worsening chest pain exacerbated bystress .
In retrospect she has had several years of rare episodes of chest pain attributed to indigestion .
On 01/14/94 she underwent a Persantine-thallium test at Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center which showed anterolateralischemia and she also developed chest pain during her study .
She was admitted for cardiac catheterization which on transfer today showed severe left main disease with occluded right coronary artery and 95 percent stenosis of the circumflex with severe proximal left anterior descending .
She was transferred to TGCHO for surgical evaluation and was stable throughout except for some chest pain during her cardiac catheterization relieved with morphine and intravenous nitroglycerin .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is above above , as well as ( 2 ) non-insulin diabetes mellitus which she is controlled on oral hypoglycemics , and ( 3 ) hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tenormin 25 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg q.d. , Diabinase 250 mg b.i.d. , nitroglycerin paste to chest wall , enteric coated aspirin one tablet PO q.d. , heparin intravenously , Dyazide 1 tablet PO q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No alcohol use and quit tobacco greater than 25 years ago with a 10-pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The vital signs were stable .
She was a pleasant obese white female in no acute distress .
HEENT examination was within normal limits ; neck was without adenopathy , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion ; heart regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds .
Abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
without deformities or varicosities .
Vascular showed 2 plus pulses except for her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses which were one plus .
She had a left carotid bruit .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the patient &apos;s severe three vessel coronary artery disease a Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained for possible coronary artery bypass grafting .
She was kept on intravenous heparin , nitroglycerin and beta blockade .
Regarding her carotid bruit a carotid non-invasive study was obtained which showed severe right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis .
In conjunction with the cardiac surgeons Dr. Ausguall from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted for carotid endarterectomy on the right .
In anticipation of her endarterectomy she underwent an MRA angiogram on 01/22/94 .
Results of the angiogram showed that she right internal carotid artery stenosis with some hemodynamic effect in the distal LCA lumen diameter .
Due to this result an urgent carotid endarterectomy along with her coronary artery bypass graft was performed on 1/25/94 .
There were no complications and postoperatively she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
She remained neurologically intact and did well from the Vascular Surgery stand point .
Her Intensive Care Unit stay was only notable for an increase in chest tube output which subsequently decreased and was removed prior to her transfer to the floor .
She had some ectopy , specifically frequent ectopic activity after her surgery for which a Cardiac Arrhythmia Service consult was obtained and she was put on a Holter monitor and echocardiogram was obtained .
She remained hemodynamically stable and wires were kept intact beyond postoperative day four since she had some evidence of heart block .
Her beta blocker was held and she continued to be in sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions .
Echocardiogram revealed her left ventricle to be within normal limits and otherwise her study was negative .
Holter monitor results were pending at the time of discharge .
Wires were subsequently discontinued and her digoxin and beta blocker were discontinued .
Otherwise her hospital course was uneventful .
She tolerated a regular diet , wounds remained clean , dry and intact and she was transferred to Villtionnca Hospital on 2/2/94 .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable and afebrile .
INSTRUCTIONS :
Were to follow up with Dr. Shondmagshao Ajesc , Dr. Wilftam Ausguall and Dr. Kote as instructed .

DISCHARGE DATE :
04/02/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Esophageal bleed .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Hepatocellular carcinoma , diabetes mellitus , cirrhosis , hepatitis C .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old man with a history of hepatitis C , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma and diabetes mellitus who was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to admission when he had an episode of hematemesis x 1 .
He discussed this with his friend at Sloan-caer/viewbonse Memorial Hospital but did not seek medical attention , hoping it would go away .
On the morning of admission , Mr. Kote awoke from sleep and immediately vomited a large quantity of blood .
He said it was large in quantity .
He had associated right upper quadrant pain and shortly thereafter passed a large black stool .
Paramedics were called and found him to have a blood pressure of 120/80 , a pulse of 92 , breathing at 16 and normally cognizant .
During transport to the Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital Emergency Room , he vomited an additional 200 cc. of dark , red blood .
In the emergency department , an NG-tube was placed and additional dark blood was suctioned .
He subsequently was lavaged to clear but had a repeat of hematemesis prompting urgent endoscopy .
On endoscopy , he was found to have Grade III varices without active bleeding in the lower one-third of the esophagus that had &quot; stigmata of bleeding and red signs . &quot;
He had additional varices in a hiatal hernia .
In total , five bands were placed .
Gastric varices were also found and there was blood in the body of the stomach .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout with blood pressures in the 150 &apos;s and heart rate in the 90 &apos;s .
There were no orthostatics , unfortunately , done .
The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis C several years ago .
He has had blood transfusions in the past but denies all intravenous drug abuse .
He has a history of alcoholism that dates back approximately 60 years , but ended 7 years ago .
He says that during the period of his alcoholism he drank &quot; As much as I could . &quot;
In May of 1998 , Mr. Kote underwent evaluation for expanding abdominal girth , nausea and vomiting .
A CT scan of the abdomen at that time revealed multiple lesions on the liver .
On needle biopsy , these lesions were found to be hepatocellular carcinoma .
His AFB at that time was 251 .
He did not undergo curative or palliative treatment at that time .
He is not a candidate for liver transplant because of his age .
At that time , he was started on Lasix and Aldactone .
Until 2 months ago , the patient had done remarkably well until he noticed an increasing abdominal girth .
He was evaluated by his primary care physician who found that he had gained 15 pounds and referred him to Dr. Lierm at Rose-tedmargpark Medical Center for diagnosis and therapeutic paracentesis , which he underwent on March 12 , 1998 .
Approximately 2 liters of clear ascitic fluid were drained at that time .
Cell counts were negative for SBP and cultures have been negative to date .
He had not had and continues not to have any episodes of fever .
He complains of right upper quadrant pain that began shortly after his paracentesis 4 days ago .
He has not had any anorexia and continues to take his outpatient medications .
He had not drank any alcohol for the past 7 years .

His EKG had normal axis , normal intervals , no LVH or RVH , tiny Q &apos;s in V3 through V6 , no T wave inversions or other indications of acute ischemia .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Our impression was this was a 73 year old man with cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatitis C , history of alcoholism in the past , history of peptic ulcer disease on aspirin without acid blockade who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple esophageal and gastric varices .
His portal hypertension resulting in a ruptured varices was almost certainly his cause of bleed .
There was no evidence of ulcers on endoscopy .
His bleed also might have been precipitated by med non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake .
The temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture .
Given the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis of cancer , the risk of worsening obstruction to portal venous flow versus ____________ was also increased .
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while his initial care that first night was , by system :
Neurologically , given the risk of hepatic encephalopathy with the recent GI bleed , he was put on lactulose 30 cc. PO titrated to 4 loose stools per day .
Cardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and TNG drip , Lasix , Aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 .
Rhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues .
His PR interval was watched as propranolol was started .
There was no evidence of ischemia .
Pulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam .
He was treated with inhalers .
There was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray .
GI wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices .
He was kept NPO .
He was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure .
He was also started on triatide , omeprazole .
In terms of Hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed .
For this , he was given 6 units of FFP , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets .
He was also given Vitamin K 10 mg. PO x 3 days .
He was treated with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis .
He was kept in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued GI bleed .
At that point , he was transferred to Carespistown Hospital for further management .
On his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike .
Despite this , he was started on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD on March 18th as well as Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia .
The major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis .
His Aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses .
In addition , Lasix was added on to help him with diuresis .
Between March 20th and March 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen .
However , after Lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and Lasix was held for 24 hours .
At that time , a dose of 20 mg. IV BID was re-instigated .
On the 400 mg. of Aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 .
Therefore , on March 25th , his Aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. PO TID and Lasix was kept at 20 mg. BID .
On this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable .
He was also kept on a low salt diet .
He was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction .
By March 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center , although he would stay in the Medical Unit there before returning back to his own room .
At discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center are :
1. Necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized .
At discharge , he was on 100 mg. Aldactone TID and 20 mg. of Lasix BID but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of Lasix to Aldactone was optimized .
2. He also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status .
3. He also needs TID fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar .
4. In terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his Flagyl 500 mg. q8hours .
For SBP prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
5. He should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet .
6. He also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible .
7. He should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his GI bleeding has stabilized .
FOLLOW UP :
1. He will follow up with his primary care physician , Dr. Portal , at Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center .
Doctor Portal has been notified of the patient &apos;s progress at Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .
2. From our GI Service , the patient will follow up with Dr. Shufftakeaakote and follow up will be arranged in GI Clinic for next week .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Prilosec 20 mg. PO BID .
2. Zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO QD .
3. Isordil 10 mg. PO TID .
4. Lopressor 12.5 mg. PO BID .
5. Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
6. Atrovent nebs q8hours .
7. Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID to stop on 3/31/1998 .
8. Albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments .
9. Lactulose 30 cc. PO BID .
10. Aldactone 100 mg. PO TID titrated to potassium .
11. Lasix 20 mg. PO BID .
12. NPH Insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional CZI Insulin based on TID fingersticks .
ADDENDUM :
Unfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his Lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome .
His potassium also climbed to 5.1 .
Because of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his Lasix and Aldactone .
Despite holding his Aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days .
It went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 .
He was treated with Kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this .
By 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 .
We then restarted a much smaller dose of Aldactoneat 50 mg. PO Q day .
This was the dose of Aldactone he had originally been admitted with .
On 3/31/98 the junior resident on Drugway Hospital , Dr. Asaleysean Portal , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care .
Patient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness .
Specifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the ACLS protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest .
He also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly GI bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken .
Specifically he did not want to be re-banded .
We also addressed the possibility of having the GI service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding .
He said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease .
The patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital where he is in residence .
Dr. Asaleysean Portal spoke with Dr. Fat of the Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
lactulose 30 cc &apos;s PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg. PO b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO Q day , Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d. , Metoprolol 12.5 mg. PO b.i.d. , Levofloxacin 250 mg. PO Q day , Atrovent nebs Q8 hours , Albuterol nebs Q8 hours , and Flagyl 500 mg. IV Q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 .
Patient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home .
He was also on Aldactone 50 mg. PO Q day .
We decided to discontinue his Lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine .
At the Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , BUN and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of Aldactone .
He should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction .
He will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with Dr. Fat at Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ventricular tachycardia .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease , hypertension .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
3-17-94 , implantation of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
3-11-94 , right heart cardiac catheterization with comprehensive electrophysiology study and radio frequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Zestril 5 mg PO q.day , Nitropatch .2 mg once daily , Sotalol 120 mg PO b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Coumadin as directed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .
He had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .
He presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in December , 1994 and was admitted to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .
The coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .
An echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .
He had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .
After the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .
The patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .
On March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .
The tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .
The patient was transferred to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .
His blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .
The carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .
The jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .
Lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .
Cardiovascular exam :
normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .
The patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .
Intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .
On March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .
During the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .
Pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .
After mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .
After radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .
However , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .
Since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .
The patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .
On March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .
Then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .
The defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was uneventful .
On March 19 , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .
Under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .
This was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .
Three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .
For tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .
For tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .
For tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .
VVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .
The patient felt good on the morning of March 20 .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .
He will have his prothrombin time checked on Monday and will follow up with the Defibrillator Clinic .

ATTENDING :
LENNI EENAHILDE BREUTZOLN MD , PHD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
Perirectal abscess and myelodysplastic syndrome .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 67-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome subtype and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation .
She was admitted for perirectal pain and fever .
HISTORY BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS :
History of MDS diagnosed in June 2002 .
At that time was evidence of disease progression with 22% blast , which led to treatment with five azacitidine on compassionate use basis starting in March 2003 .
On admission , she was status post three cycles of chemotherapy .
Her course have been complicated by perirectal pain and thrombosed hemorrhoids .
After her third cycle of chemotherapy , the patient noted worsening of her rectal pain along with fever and chills .
CT done as an outpatient showed inflammation and hemorrhoids but no obvious abscess .
The patient continues with rectal pain and fevers and eventually went to an outside hospital Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center where CT scan revealed a tiny area on the right consistent with hemorrhoids versus a tiny perirectal abscess as said initially , but the pain was secondary to hemorrhoids and anal fissure and local care was provided .
The patient &apos;s status worsened with continued elevated temperatures to 103 and increase in rectal pain .
The patient noted a yellowish drainage from the rectum .
The patient was then transferred on 7/14/03 to the Gaanvantsir due to her high-risk status .
Review of the CT scan from an outside hospital likely perirectal abscess given the CT was limited by not having IV ororal contrast .
The patient reports on admission having yellowish drainage from rectum occasionally pink , but no frank blood .
The stools were soft but formed .
Although , initially she has had constipation after starting chemotherapy .
She noted also nausea , decreased appetite , and decreased p.o. intake .
Also of note , on admission , she had increased urinary frequency but no difficulty urinating .
No weakness .
No abdominal pain .
Her temperature was elevated to 103 , but her blood pressure had been stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. From an infectious disease standpoint , she has a perirectal abscess .
Ceptaz and Flagyl were both started .
Blood cultures were done each morning for the first week with no growth during her hospitalization and her urinalysis and cultures were negative .
Surgery here saw the patient on 7/15/03 and they did an incision and drainage of her perirectal abscess and recommended daily sitz bath and also recommended increasing her p.o. water and fiber intake over the following two days , although the patient developed a rectal fistula for which surgery again had to be called .
They placed the drain and continued to follow the patient .
The patient continued to spike temperatures with perirectal pain after surgery and the Nasalide was added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for enterococcus and MRSA given the patient &apos;s resistence to ampicillin B and her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus .
The patient spiked only once after beginning with Nasalide and had been afebrile for six days before discharge .
About three days of discharge , her PICC site became inflamed , but the patient remained stable and afebrile .
Her PICC line was pulled and the patient was switched off oral antibiotics .
She remained stable and afebrile for two days before being discharged and after starting her p.o. antibiotics .
From pain perspective , we used OxyContin and oxycodone , which was titrated up during her hospitalization to maximize pain control and for ease of bathroom use .
2. From diet perspective FEN , she was hyponatremic on admission , which was secondary to her dehydration and resolved with hydration .
Her nutritional status is poor on admission with low albumin and an elevated INR .
She was given vitamin K and Nutrition was consulted .
With supplements and multivitamins and encouragement , the patient improved and had increased liquid and solid intake prior to discharge .
3. Cardiovascular wise , the patient has history of hypertension , although blood pressure was not elevated during her hospitalization and hydrochlorothiazide she had on admission was discontinued .
4. Rheumatalogically , the patient has history of rheumatoid arthritis .
She was on 1 mg of prednisone every other day , which was tapered and discontinued .
This patient had no episodes of rheumatic pain .
5. From psychosocial plans perspective , the patient lives with her sister in Pupeake Su Park and was discharged to her sister &apos;s care with SMH services for continued home care .
6. From Hematology / Oncology perspective , although the patient did not undergo any chemotherapy during this hospitalization .
Bone marrow biopsy was done on 7/17/03 and the results were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient will follow up with her oncologist for her final results and for further treatment .
6. From genitourinary perspective , the patient complained of difficulty urinating .
She was started on Ditropan and that was suggested to optimize relief of symptoms .
On discharge , the patient had fewer complaints of difficulty starting her urine and upon discharge is to follow up with her PCP for further treatment .
The patient was advised at discharge to eat high fiber and plenty of fluids to do sitz baths five times daily .
She was scheduled for surgical follow up and was advised to call her PCP for fever , chills , worsening rectal pain , or increased rectal drainage .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Peridex mouth wash 12% 10 mL b.i.d. , clotrimazole one troche by mouth four times daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 0.5-1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea and anxiety , Flagyl 500 mg p.o.q.8h. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , senna tablets two tablets by mouth twice daily , multivitamin with mineral one tablet p.o. everyday , Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.6h. , OxyContin 10 mgp .o. q.12h. , and Levaquin 500 mg p.o. everyday .
PROCEDURES :
Perirectal abscess incision and drainage done by surgery at the bedside , which was complicated by provision of a perirectal abscess and again the patient had to undergone under local anesthesia perirectal examination of her perirectal fistula with drain placement that was only her only complication .
CONDITION :
Her condition was stable upon discharge .
She will be discharged to her sister &apos;s home and with SMH follow up for wound care .

The patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey .
He also received a four-day Decadron burst .
The patient had pain in the L3 distribution .
His MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain .
Radiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass .
Urinary retention .
Although there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention .
Fevers .
His blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission .
His chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers .
The patient was placed on Levaquin .
Shortness of breath .

01/08/2004
The patient has a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
He is admitted at this time because of significant GI bleeding .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Significant for fatigue and increased abdominal discomfort .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION :
Insulin , Celexa , Protonix , Ambien and Pancreas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs showed his blood pressure to be slightly decreased at 120/60 , pulse 64 , respirations 16 , temperature 98.8 , O2 sat 95 .
HEENT :
Evidence of anemia with being pale , but anicteric , no oral lesions .
Neck supple .

Heart regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , mildly tender in the epigastrium without hepatosplenomegaly , mass or tenderness .
Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .

BRIEF HISTORY :
She is a 57-year-old chronic dialysis patient who was admitted with an occluded right forearm dialysis AV graft and hyperkalemia .
The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft .
She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate .
She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices .
PREVIOUS HISTORY :
1. Endstage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease status post failed transplant on chronic hemodialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center .
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
3. Restless leg syndrome .
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm .
5. Hyperlipidemia .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
As detailed in fellow and nurse practitioner notes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile .
Vital signs stable .
Blood pressure 90/40 to 110/60 .
Alert and orientated .
Pleasant .
Chest :
Clear anteriorly and at bases .
Normal cardiac sounds .
Ejection systolic murmur .
Abdomen :
Benign .
Right forearm :
AV graft with extensive hematoma and ecchymosis and difficulty to access .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 .
BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Dialysis :
She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term .
She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically .
Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range .
Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending .
The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease .
She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement .
She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties .
3. Metabolic :
Hyperkalemia as noted .
Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access .
Anemia :
Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures .
Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting .
Increase dose of EPO .
No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented .
The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and with Dr. N Tland at DH .
She will have scheduled appointment made through the vascular access program for access revision .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in May .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

CC :
Atypical CP 54 yo smoker , hx of hyperlipidemia , htn , DM , TAH / BSO age 48 , and hx of atypical cp .
She presented in 1999 and stress-ECHO , she exercised 9.5 min without pain , ECHO was nl with no wall motional abn , but EKG showed 1mm ST depressions .
In 2001 , she again p / w CP and ETT again showed 1mm ST depression , exercised 9min .

An ETT was done--pt exercised 9.5 min and there was 2mm ST depression inferiorly and laterally where persisted for 10 minutes during rest .
Enzymes flat .
*** Initial Plan *** ***
CV isch :
Pt has sig risk factors for CAD .
But given no symptoms during exercise x 9.5 min and neg enzymes after exercise , CP is likely not CAD .
However , she is still at high risk for CAD .
Will plan for Cath on 5/24 .
Cont ASA , Lopressor , Zocor .
*** Vasc :
LENI &apos;s to rule out DVT of R leg
*** Endo :
CZI sliding scale .
*** Hosp course ***
Enzymes were flat x3 and pt was ruled out for MI .
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed clean coronary arteries .
Therefore , she pain was not cardiac .
It is important to note in the future that she physiologically develops 1-2 mm ST depressions during ETT and she reports no pain during ETT .
She should have Stress MIBI or Stress ECHO if there is suspicion of CAD in to future .
Lower extremitiy non-invasives were performed for the R leg &quot; heat &quot; which were negative .

In addition , a well-healed scar at the right costovertebral angle was noted , consistent with his history of nephrectomy .
EXTREMITIES :
There was evidence for chronic venous changes on his lower extremities .
His pulses were 2+ .
There was no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
NEURO :
Nonfocal .
RECTAL :
Guaiac negative , good anal tone .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 128 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 87 , bicarb 24 , BUN 27 , creatinine 1.1 , and glucose 105 .
In addition , his LDH was elevated to 323 .
His ALT was 33 , his AST was 50 .
Alkaline phosphatase of 81 .
Bilirubin of 0.8 .
His white count was 14.9 , hematocrit 41.7 , platelet count of 487 .
His coagulation profile was within normal limits .
Chest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the 14th , with a tiny effusion on the 20th , the night of admission .
The pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .
Sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .
His electrocardiogram was within normal limits .
His urine sediment was basically within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .
The differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .
(1) Pneumonia .
He was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .
The pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .
He was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .
The ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .
However , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .
In addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .
His urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .
However , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .
However , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .
Therefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .
In addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .
After admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .
However , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .
Because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .
Therefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .
The chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .
His sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .
The Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .
Despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .
It should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .
Additionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.
(2) Hypertension .
While in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .
(3) Hyponatremia .
While in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient &apos;s Profile 7 labs .
It was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .
While in the hospital , there were no complications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .
DISPOSITION :
His condition on discharge was stable .
He was discharged to home .
He has a followup appointment with Dr. Naaan Jesc , in the Tonwe Hospital Pulmonary Clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint .
His estimated disability is mild .
We are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Orthostatic hypotension .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
Hyponatremia .
Hypokalemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the Middso Memorial Hospital Emergency Room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .
During the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .
She felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .
In the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .
The patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .
Over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .
Stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .
She also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .
She is married and lives with her husband .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an agitated elderly white female .
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on Dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .
HEENT :
Showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Extraocular muscles intact .
Oropharynx benign .
Eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
Carotids were 2+ .
No palpable thyroid .
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiac exam revealed S1 , S2 with an intermittent S4 without murmur or rubs .
Abdominal exam was benign .
Extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .
Neurologic exam :
The patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .
Light touch was intact .
ADMISSION LABS :
Sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .
Platelets 310 .
PT and PTT were normal .
LFT &apos;s were within normal limits .
Admission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .
Chest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .
Echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .
Because the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .
All cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .
The infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .
The patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .
Because Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .
However , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .
The patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .
Also , TSH was normal on admission .
Thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .
However , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .
EMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .
Additional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .
Other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .
LH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .
Galactin levels were within normal limits .
ANA was negative .
Ace level was negative .
Heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .
An anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .
On hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .
At that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .
Her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .
In the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .
The patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .
Subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .
Because of the patient &apos;s significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
However , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .
The patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .
Prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .
Because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .
A new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .
She will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .
Multi-vitamin one p.o. q day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be discharged to home .
She will follow-up with Jacrendonate Sella , M.D. on 8/6/95 .
She will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
At the time of discharge , studies that were pending included a repeat thyroid function panel , aldosterone levels and anti-WHO and anti-YO and RI antibodies .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mayta Neek is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. Queszucenove Tadl at Cochusetts Medical Center .
He presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .
He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .
His first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .
He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .
He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .
He had normal left ventricular function .
He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .
The left main was normal .
The LAD was also occluded .
The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .
The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .
The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .
He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .
The LIMA was left from the first surgery .
He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .
He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .
He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .
He also has had cataract repairs .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His social history is that he lives in Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota with his wife Second .
He has four children .
He is present in a Capefrecam Luhthousy .
He does not drink and does not smoke .
ALLERGIES :
He is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .
His blood pressure is 130/75 .
His pulse is 50 and regular .
His neck veins are not distended .
His head and neck exam is normal .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .
His abdomen is benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
His neurologic exam was nonfocal .
He is fully oriented .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .
Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .
There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .
The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .
The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .
This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .
It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .
Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .
He tolerated the procedure well .
He was monitored for the day .
He ambulated without difficulty .
He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital &apos;s .
He will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely .

Her gynecological history is notable for endometriosis and Ms. Straight is status post total abdominal hysterectomy in 2002 .
Her CA-125 preoperatively was 23 .
Ms. Straight was consented for diagnostic laparoscopy , excision of pelvic mass , and possible removal of right ovary .
Operative risks were reviewed with the patient per Dr. Eak including the risks of conversion to laparotomy .
She had a preoperative bowel prep .
PAST GYN HISTORY :
Endometriosis , status post total abdominal hysterectomy in 2002 for fibroids .
PAST OB HISTORY :
G2 , P2 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Denies smoking , alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
No family history of breast , colon or gynecological malignancies .
No family of history of cardiac disease , hypertension , and diabetes mellitus .
HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
On July 27 , 2006 , Ms. Straight underwent pelviscopy that was converted to a laparotomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , right ileal resection with primary reanastomosis and appendectomy .
Please refer to operative report dictation for full details of the operative course .
Briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
In the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
General surgical consultation was obtained from Dr. Obe who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
An approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
The estimated blood loss was 200 ml .
The final surgical pathology showed a right hemorrhagic cyst of undetermined origin with extensive adhesions , peri-appendiceal adhesions and ileum with adhesions .
Postoperatively , Ms. Straight was maintained with an NG tube and bowel rest until postoperative day #5 when she passed flatus .
Of note , on postoperative day #3 and #4 , she spiked isolated temperatures to 101 .
Evaluation was unrevealing in terms of focal source of her fever .
The urine and blood cultures were negative .
Chest x-ray was negative .
After postoperative day #4 , she experienced no further episodes of fever .
Following her NG tube discontinuation on postoperative day #5 , she experienced three to four episodes of bilious emesis .
On examination , her abdomen was nondistended and she had normal bowel sounds .
A KUB confirmed no evidence of an ileus or obstruction .
She was managed conservatively and kept npo for one night and then her diet was advanced slowly .
By the evening of postoperative day #7 , she was tolerating full house diet and had two spontaneous bowel movements .
It was unclear her etiology of her emesis following NG tube removal although possibly secondary to a subclinical ileus .
It is also a possibility that she had gastroenteritis from her relative who had presented recently to the ED with similar course of low grade fevers , emesis that resolved in short course .
At time of discharge ( postoperative day #8 08/04/06 ) , she was tolerating a house diet .
She was voiding ambulating and had remained afebrile for over 72 hours .
She was deemed to appropriate for discharge home with followup with Dr. Eak in five weeks .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
GI bleed .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient &apos;s hospital course is as follows :
Patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool .
The day prior to admission , he experienced dyspnea on exertion , and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness .
He denied any melana , any hematemesis , nausea or vomiting .
He was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21 , blood pressure 90/60 , and his INR was 3.3 .
Of note , he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve .
He was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells .
On further questioning , the patient reported that he started to feel &quot; different &quot; several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate .
He was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion .
He denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction .
Patient was last admitted to Padrugmoff Hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5 , and was asymptomatic prior to admission .
At that time , he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative .
He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate .
EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE LO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM :
On arrival at the Lo Hospital Emergency Room :
He was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 L of a nasal cannula .
General exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as follows :
History of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel CABG in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with St. Jude &apos;s valve in 09/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior GI bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on 05/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli .
The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
Included Lasix , Lopressor , Coumadin , Diovan , torsemide , Flomax , Protonix , Senekot , potassium , vitamin C , iron , and a multivitamin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for no tobacco , no alcohol .
He has a wife with Alzheimer &apos;s who lives in a skilled-nursing facility .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a BUN and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 .
White count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 .
His INR was also 3.4 .
PTT was 55 .
His EKG was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm .
His UA had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 .
His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions .
OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
DISPOSITION :
Was discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .
He was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His final medications on discharge were as follows :
Aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .
Of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. Gilbert .

Head computerized tomography scan of 10/23 :
the area of hemorrhage the same , slightly more edema and mass effect .
Pulmonary angiogram :
no evidence of pulmonary emboli .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua &apos;s cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .

She was sent home with pain control .
Cultures were pending .
Over the past days before admission , the patient had been complaining of increased arm pain .
Of note , the patient states that her pain is so bad that she was not taking her insulin .
On the morning of admission , the son could not reach her by phone .
He was concerned .
LRAH then called to say that they found her in the house very confused , called EMS , and she was brought into the hospital .
Per the son , patient not complaining of any other problems ; no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no upper respiratory symptoms , no cough , no dysuria , and no abdominal pain .
Of note , blood cultures from Christmas Eve grew MSSA in the blood .
In the emergency room , she was given 6 units subcu , with no resolve , then insulin drip at 6 units per hour , then increased to 10 including with IV hydration , and she was started on nafcillin for MSSA .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

Her medications on admission included Lasix 80 , Norvasc 2.5 , Lopressor 50 b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 q. day , Risperdal one q. day , Humulin 70/30 40 U in the morning and 25 U in the evening , regular insulin scale , carbamazepine 100 , and Neurontin .
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She walks with a cane , has LRAH care , no tobacco , no alcohol , no drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION :
She was afebrile at 97.6 , heart rate 102 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 192/92 .
In general , she was an obese African American woman in no acute distress , mumbling .
HEENT :
Pupils equal and reactive , her oropharynx was moist with no lesions .
Cardiovascularly , she was tachycardic , normal S1 and S2 , regular , no murmurs .
JVP was flat .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , no masses , no rebound , and no guarding .
EXTREMITIES :
She had swelling in the right arm , very , very minimal .
Her right arm was on a sling .
In her lower extremities , she had bilateral edema to the knees , 2+.
NEURO :
She was oriented to person only , intermittently following commands .
Labs were notable for blood cultures positive for MSSA .
Chest x-ray was pending at the time of admission .
Head CT was negative .
EKG showed normal sinus , no ST changes .
Her labs were notable on admission for a sodium of 129 , creatinine of 2.0 , hematocrit of 34 , albumin was 2.5 .
She had a gap of 14 .
Her ABG was 7.40 , 47 , 90 .
Her CKs and troponins were negative .
Her beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.36 .
Her UA showed 3+ protein , 5-8 WBCs , 8-10 RBCs , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
This is a 55-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with HHNK .
At the time , she was treated for such , including IV fluids and an insulin drip .
She recovered very nicely .
Continued hospital course , she recovered well from her HHNK .
Ortho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .
Tap showed that she had an active infection , with 464000 WBCs , 198000 RBCs , including 88% polys , from the right shoulder .
Therefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the OR emergently .
In the operating room , 40-50 cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .
She received IV fluids and had an estimated blood loss of 1200 cc .
The patient &apos;s crit dropped from a baseline of 32 to 19 .
She was also not following commands and her glucose was 876 .
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit on 12/30/02 , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .
She stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until 1/5/03 .
She was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .
Cultures still showed MSSA .
Hospital course during the MICU stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .
She received multiple units of blood for this .
Also , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume IV fluids .
She required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .
She responded well and then the dopa was D / c&apos;d on 1/4/03 .
From the ID perspective , the patient had a TTE on 12/30 that showed an EF of 65% , question of a mobile echodensity along the RV , but no proof of endocarditis .
This was significant in that the head CT done on 1/4/03 to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .
There was no recommendation for further workup .
She was transferred to the floor on 1/5/03 , and by system :
1. ID :
She was continued to be treated for MSSA bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .
2. RENAL :
Patient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .
Secondary to all the IV fluids she received in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 L / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of 80 mg IV as needed .
3. Cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an EKG that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .
She does have known CAD from previous echos .
She has been stable .
She is on a beta blocker .
Her ACE inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .
4. NEUROLOGICAL :
Her head CT showed a right parietal infarct .
Patient should have an MRI as an outpatient to follow up .
Most likely represents an ischemic stroke .
Workup for B12 and RPR studies were all negative .
5. GI-wise , the patient had been started on tube feeds ; however , she recovered and NG tube was D / c&apos;d and patient taking p.o.&apos;s .
She was also started on lactulose to increase her bowel movements as needed .
Her ammonia level is normalized .
6. Heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .
7. Endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her NPH dose .
Plan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of IV antibiotics .
She will return to see Dr. Ayan Koteskismanhout in orthopaedic surgery in 10-12 weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .
If the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .
For access , the patient will have a PICC line in order to continue IV fluids .
The discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate 1250 b.i.d. , carbamazepine 100 p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose 15-30 mL p.o. q.i.d. as needed .
She will also be discharged on insulin 70/30 52 U in the morning 30 U in the evening , M.V.I. therapeutic , Neurontin 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4 h. , Risperdal 1 mg p.o. q. day , Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4 h. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 6-8 h. p.r.n. , Atrovent nebulizer .5 mg q.i.d. , and she should restart an ACE inhibitor , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day .

He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient &apos;s Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .

IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This is a 63-year-old lady with stage IV colon cancer , status post three chemo regimens , then she was on a phase one trial .
She presented with increasing LFTs and renal failure .
1. Hypertension , infectious disease .
The patient was hypertensive to 60s through much of her stay .
She had E. coli in her urine and she was placed on Levaquin .
Differential diagnosis included urosepsis and intravascular sleep depletion .
Because of her rising LFTs and renal failure , she was thought to be in hepatorenal , see below .
We continued to administer serum-poor albumin throughout the day even until her death .
2. Renal failure .
The patient was in acute renal failure and had hypertension .
The differential diagnosis included hypertension , hypovolemia , and nephrotoxicity due to the drug , and tumor lysis leading to hepatorenal or hepatorenal in itself .
The patient had a renal ultrasound .
This showed mild left hydronephrosis , no real etiology for this .
Her creatinine is slowly climbed to greater than 4.6 upon her death .
She was in fluid restriction to 1.5 litres a day .
Renal failure was thought likely to be due to hypovolemia from hyperperfusion as well as hepatorenal syndrome .
We continued allopurinol .
3. Increasing LFTs and INR .
The patient had increasing LFTs and her T. bili climbed to greater than 9 upon death .
This is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome .
Also , the patient could have had the tumor metabolizing .
There was no evidence of obstruction .
4. The patient &apos;s increased LDH , uric acid , and BUN and creatinine are all consistent with tumor lysis .
This is likely thought to be due to an increased tumor burden and not necessarily from the medication .
It became clear throughout the patient &apos;s hospital course that she was becoming very sick and the patient accepted this .
With her wishes that her she was DNR / DNI , we eventually made her CMO , comfort measures only .
She was awake and entertaining friends and family through most of her hospital stay .
She often may talk openly about her death that was impending .
On the two days prior to her death , she was more unresponsive and on the day of her death , she was unconscious through most of the day .
The patient was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. on 04/16/05 .

She smoked two cigarettes per day x30 years , but quit in the 1960s .
She is a former museum curator .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , afebrile , pulse in the 60s , saturating in the upper 90s at rest on room air .
With exertion , she was noted to desaturate to the mid 70s .
There was no significant JVP elevation .
Breath sounds were diminished at the right base along with dullness to percussion at the right base .
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal P2 .
There was no RV heave .
No murmur was appreciated .
Abdomen was mildly distended , but soft and nontender .
There was trace pretibial leg edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Walking underwent thoracentesis by interventional radiology .
They removed 600 cc of yellow fluid .
Fluid characteristics were exudative .
Cytology and microbiology including AFP cultures are pending at this time .
After the thoracentesis , Ms. Walking &apos;s ambulatory room air saturation was 94% and she was feeling better .
Ms. Walking also underwent echocardiogram .
Her LV ejection fraction was 77% .
The estimated RV systolic pressure was 47 .
Because of a concern of a solid mass on the lesser curvature of her stomach noted by abdominal CAT scan , Ms. Walking had a GI consultation .
The gastroenterologist performed an EGD and EUS .
The EGD showed a normal esophagus , a submucosal mass in the cardia and fundus of the stomach with central umbilication , nodularity in the prepyloric antrum , and a normal duodenum .
The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .
Of note , there was an extensive differential diagnosis for her unilateral effusion including malignancy , tuberculosis , drug-induced lupus and less likely pestis related .
The exudative nature of the effusion argues against congestive heart failure or hepatic hydrothorax .
Ms. Walking was stable at the time of discharge .
She was discharged home .

CBC , white count 6.7 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 280 .
Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .
Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .

She was intubated , received general anesthesia , and 350 cc of fluid .
The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken to the post anesthesia care unit -- the surgery without complications .
She was noted to have rapid shallow breathing with oxygen saturations of 87% , a heart rate of 95 to 100 , blood pressure of 208 to 90 .
The patient was given albuterol nebs , 10 of intravenous Lasix , 15 mg of esmolol , 2 mg of intravenous morphine and was put on 100% nonrebreather with improvement of her oxygen saturations to 98% and her blood pressure decreased to 164/70 .
A chest x-ray was consistent with interstitial edema .
An arterial blood gas was done when the patient was at her nadir which came back as oxygen saturations of 67 , CO2 of 57 , pH of 7.28 and that is when oxygen saturations were 87% .
The patient urinated greater than 400 cc to Lasix .
She was transferred to the Well General Hospital for congestive heart failure / rule out myocardial infarction .
The history was taken via Spanish interpreter and was very vague .
She denies chest pain now but states that she always has chest pain later in the interview , and was unable to be more specific .
She denies current shortness of breath , history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure .
The patient was admitted to Ca Valley Hospital on 4-9-95 with substernal chest pain and ruled out at that time for myocardial infarction .
An exercise tolerance test in 04/95 was without ischemia .

Her temperature was 98.1 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations 20 , oxygen saturations 100% on 60% face mask .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination demonstrated oropharynx clear , patch over left eye , pupil was round and reflexive to light on the right , right extraocular movements were intact , jugular venous distention was about 7 centimeters .
There was no lymphadenopathy , carotids were 2+ without bruits bilaterally .
Lungs :
there were crackles bilaterally approximately one half of the way up , no wheezes or rhonchi .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs , point of maximum impulse was within normal limits .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended , obese , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no edema on the right , trace edema on the left .
No clubbing , cyanosis , feet without signs of infection .
The rectal examination demonstrated guaiac negative brown stool with good rectal tone .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient had admission sodium 137 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 30.6 , BUN and creatinine 20 and 1.4 , glucose 261 , calcium 8.6 , phosphate 3.6 , magnesium 1.1 , total protein 7.3 , albumin 3.2 , globulin 4.1 , direct bilirubin 0 , total bilirubin 0.5 , serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 65 , lactic acid dehydrogenase 292 , creatine kinase 186 with isos less than 0.4 , white blood count 8.8 , hematocrit 32.0 , platelet count 167,000 , mean corpuscular volume 87 .
The chest x-ray was as per history of present illness .
The electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute , questionable minor ST depression in V4 through V6 , T wave flattening in AVL .
Compared with a Ca Valley Hospital 7-17-96 electrocardiogram , V3 T waves are now upright , inverted T wave in 07/96 .
Also , T waves peaked in today &apos;s electrocardiogram consistent with hyperkalemia , otherwise without change .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure indicated by her chest x-ray , lung examination and history .
She responded well to Lasix and on 1-25 had clear lungs on examination and normal oxygen saturations on room air .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 72% , trace mitral regurgitation , a left ventricle with no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities .
There was also trace tricuspid insufficiency .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no shunt flow was detected by color Doppler .
The patient &apos;s episode of failure was thought to be most likely be due to diastolic dysfunction precipitated by tachycardia and hypertension .

DISCHARGE DATE :
03/28/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .

Discharge Date :
06/12/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1) EXTENSIVE POSTERIOR CIRCULATION INFARCTION .
2) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .
General :
The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
Neck was supple with full range of motion .
No bruits were heard .
Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
There was no pupillary defect .
Dolls eye was negative .
There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
Corneals were present bilaterally .
Gag was present weakly .
Face was symmetrical .
Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12/15/95
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/18/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
chest pain , ruled out for myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
asthma .
HISTORY :
52-year-old female , with a history of of nonsteroid dependent asthma , presenting with chest discomfort .
The patient stated that the previous week while in a pulmonary rehabilitation program , she underwent an exercise tolerance test .
During the procedure , she complained of a squeezing sensation in the chest , apparently associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The day of admission , she noted the onset of the same chest pressure , radiating to the right shoulder , which she described as an &quot; awful feeling in her chest . &quot;
This lasted several hours and was relieved in the Emergency Department .
Mild nausea but not other cardiac related symptoms .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
history of cigarette use , post menopausal , hypercholesterolemia .
In 1991 , she had an equivocal exercise tolerance test with a normal thallium study .
The patient also described a long history of &quot; cold weather &quot; exertion related chest discomfort that involved her &quot; sternum , back and insides , &quot; associated with asthma but not relieved by metered dose inhalers .
This symptoms she reports has been stable for years and was different than her presenting complaints .
On PHYSICAL EXAMINATION , 110/80 bilaterally , 68 , 18 .
Black female in no apparent distress .
Chest clear to auscultation .
Cardiovascular :
regular , without murmur , gallop or rub .
No increased jugular venous pressure .
Abdomen soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , no abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema or G .
Rectal :
guaiac negative .
Electrocardiogram :
poor R-wave progression , no change versus 12/93 .
Chest x-ray study :
low volumes , no active disease .
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES :
complete blood count , electrolytes , creatinine normal .
This 52-year-old patient with a history of asthma , atypical chest pain , and recently positive exercise tolerance test was admitted to the medical service with a similar chest pain , which was not associated with electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by creatine kinase enzymes .
Given the similarity of her current presentation to her recent positive stress test , and wish to avoid beta blockade , due to her asthma , an inpatient thallium study was ordered .
While in the hospital she remained pain free .
She exhibited no bronchospasm while taking enteric coated aspirin .
When an exercise thallium study was unable to be obtained 48 hours after admission , the patient was discharged to follow up for an out patient study and with her internist , Dr. Kanner .
At discharge , she looked and felt well .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PNEUMONIA WITH QUESTION OF ASPIRATION .
PROBLEMS :
1) DEMENTIA DUE TO PICK &apos;S DISEASE .
2) HISTORY OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY .
3) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
4) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 71 year-old male with Pick &apos;s disease causing dementia who presented one day after having eaten one-half bar of Ivory soap .
The following day on the day of admission , he was noted to have a gurgling sound in his throat by his daughter .
His daughter brought him to Nor Memorial Hospital where he was noted to have a fever of 102 degrees .
A chest x-ray at that time showed a right middle lobe infiltrate .
He was treated with Ceftriaxone and transferred to Ver Medical Center .
At that time , his temperature was 100.2 degrees .
He had an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air .
He was noted to have a potassium of 2.6 .
Chest x-ray was re-read and confirmed as a right middle lobe pneumonia .
He received 600 mg of intravenous Clindamycin to cover for anaerobes in case there was aspiration and was admitted for treatment of his pneumonia .
His mental status was noted to be at baseline by the family .
He is essentially nonverbal answering &quot; no &quot; or &quot; I don&apos;t know &quot; to most questions .
History was obtained from the medical record and the family .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As mentioned in the problem list .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature 100.6 degrees , heart rate 102 , blood pressure 107/54 , oxygen saturation 92% on room air .
In general , he was an elderly white male sleeping flat in no acute distress , awakened easily , but was not oriented at all .
HEENT examination was benign .
Neck had no jugular venous distension and 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits .
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs appreciated .
Lungs had rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally , scattered throughout , no egophony or clear area of consolidation was noted .
The abdomen was benign .
The extremities were without edema and had 2+ distal pulses .
Neurological examination was alert , but not oriented .
He followed some simple commands .
He moves all extremities well .
Gait was not tested .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission included a sodium of 140 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 29 , BUN 22 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 98 .
White blood cell count was 1.73 , hematocrit 37.0 , platelet count 215 .
Chest x-ray revealed a right middle lobe opacity , no effusion , no edema .
EKG was normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and right bundle branch block with prior inferior myocardial infarction .
There is no prior EKG available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and given a course of p.o. antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Flagyl with plans for a fourteen day course .
He initially received oxygen , two liters via nasal cannula , but had an oxygen saturation that remained at 92% on room air , so oxygen was discontinued .
His potassium was repleted from 2.6 up to 3.3 the day after admission and then up to 4.2 two days after admission .
The source for his hypokalemia was unknown .
He initially had watery diarrhea , thought secondary to soap ingestion which resolved two days after admission .
He was gently hydrated with 1/2 normal saline for two liters to keep up with his gastrointestinal losses .
He was continued on Risperdal which he takes for dementia .
He did have fevers the day after admission , but his fever curve gradually came down .
Because of the question of aspiration , a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained .
Before this evaluation , discussion was undertaken with the family who decided that even if the patient were aspirating that they would not want a feeding jejunal tube for feeding placed .
Speech evaluation felt that he may be aspirating occasionally when he coughs , however they did not recommend dietary modifications , but only that he be given soft , easily chewed items .
They also suggested that he be observed at meals to make sure that he paces himself to avoid aspirating .
They recommended follow-up evaluation if he develops further pneumonias or if he has increased coughing .
This can be arranged through his primary care physician or through the rehabilitation hospital if he is still an inpatient at rehabilitation .
The family also decided to make the patient DNR / DNI after he was admitted .
He will be transferred to rehabilitation to finish his course of antibiotics and to work on ambulation .
He will then return home with HMC services to live with his daughter-in-law and son .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
PERFORATED APPENDICITIS AND APPENDICEAL ABSCESS .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS WAS NONE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old white female who presented to the Emergency Department at the Ver Medical Center with a chief complaint of diffuse abdominal pain which was periumbilical in origin .
Patient had experienced periumbilical pain which was nonradiating , mild , and stable for approximately three days .
In addition , she had had three days of nausea and vomiting .
She complained of no dysuria and no vaginal or urinary discharge .
Her last meal was on the day of admission .
Her last bowel movement was two days prior to admission and her last menstrual period was on November 6 , 1997 .
Patient did note some slight anorexia .
PAST MEDICAL / SURGICAL HISTORY :
Unremarkable .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
She took no medications .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit , heart rate 115 , and blood pressure 139/89 .
HEENT :
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , and pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
CHEST :
Lungs were clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
Positive bowel sounds , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , no costovertebral angle tenderness , no hernia , and no rebound or guarding .
There was mild right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant tenderness and no masses palpable .
RECTAL :
Nontender and hemoccult negative .
PELVIC :
Examination showed no masses and mild cervical motion tenderness .
EXTREMITIES :
No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
NEUROLOGICAL :
No focal deficits .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Studies revealed that chemistries were within normal limits , white blood cell count was 20.8000 , hematocrit was 38 , and platelets were 272,000 .
KUB was performed in the Emergency Room which showed dilated loops of small bowel with no air fluid levels .
In addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .
The pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .
Chest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta HCG was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .
She was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .
On the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .
The colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .
This was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .
There were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .
The primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .
A delayed CT scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed CT scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .
At this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .
The patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .
Over the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .
Sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .
Patient &apos;s physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .
After the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .
Repeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .
This CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .
The appendix was not well visualized .
The repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .
These were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .
Given the progression of the patient &apos;s CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .
Patient &apos;s bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .
She experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .
On December 3 , 1997 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. Zamorryn He .
No ileocecectomy was performed .
Cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .
These peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
The patient &apos;s perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl ) were continued .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery Room then subsequently to the floor .
Pain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .
Patient &apos;s nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .
On postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .
Her abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .
She had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .
Two Jackson-Pratts were placed intraoperatively .
At the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the Jackson-Pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .
The patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on December 8 , 1997 .
Her Jackson-Pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and Flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which includes an additional nine days of antibiotics with the patient &apos;s operative date being considered day one of antibiotics .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 51 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with pain in her stomach times two weeks and was noted to have a very increased BUN and creatinine in the Emergency Room .
The patient was in her usual state of very good health until about two weeks ago .
She had never been hospitalized .
On November 29 , 1996 through Christmas , 1996 , the patient went to Burg and she said that the last two weeks in Burg , she had neck pain on the right and some pain her throat .
She received a shot of an unknown medication as well as pills which she believed were Keflex but vomited each time she took the pills so she only took these for three days and did not complete her whole course of antibiosis .
The patient &apos;s neck pain resolved some but she began coughing and her throat still hurt .
In three days , she also started to have some upper abdominal pain , constant burning with eating , and also , she had some vomiting .
She was able to keep fluids down .
The patient saw a Burgan medical doctor on 12/25/96 for throat and belly pain and received another shot in each leg .
She also had some intermittent loose stool with no melena or bright red blood per rectum .
The patient &apos;s emesis was yellow and her cough was productive of sputum .
On work-up in the Emergency Room on the day of admission , the patient was found to have a BUN and creatinine of 65 and 9.1.
Her primary medical doctor was called and reported this was absolutely new .
She received one liter of normal saline , Demerol , Vistaril , Maalox .
Patient &apos;s last menstrual period was the week before , she had no dysuria , no headache , no vaginal discharge , and no swelling of her legs , and no blood in her urine .
She had been drinking coconut water soda and was not really eating solids .
She had some fatigue and some thirst but no history of any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for adult onset diabetes mellitus since 1993 and also status post surgery for an ectopic pregnancy in the past .

Glucotrol 5 q.d. , Keflex , and an unknown antacid .
ALLERGIES :

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a generally tired appearing female in no acute distress .
Her vital signs were temperature 97.4 , pulse of 72 , blood pressure was 156/90 , and 95% on room air .
HEENT :
Examination was completely unremarkable with a non-traumatic head , extraocular movements were intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , clear oropharynx , no sinus tenderness , and mucous membranes were slightly dry .

CARDIAC :
Examination showed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , gallops , or rubs .

Her PT and PTT were 11.9 and 25.6 and her INR was 1 .
Her urinalysis was pending at the time of admission , chest x-ray was pending , and EKG was normal with maybe a downgoing T in III and V1 .
Her ultrasound showed a normal gallbladder , normal pancreas , maybe some mild infiltration of her liver , no hydronephrosis , and the kidneys were not noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Basically on admission , it was somewhat unclear what was the etiology of both her hyponatremia as well as her high creatinine .
The patient , of course , was seen by Renal and a renal biopsy was discussed .
Renal biopsy was done on 12/27/96 and was uncomplicated .
The results showed focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and was ? _ ? immune .
Patient was given cyclophosphamide 980 mg intravenously times one , Solu-Medrol one gram intravenously q.d. times three days , and she was started on Amphojel , nephrocaps , and calcium carbonate .
She was kept on a fluid restriction of 1000 cc per day for her poor urine output .
Patient was also put on a renal diet .
Patient had symptoms of epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting probably secondary to her medications .
Slowly , however , that resolved and also , she had some encouraging signs of diuresis with decrease in creatinine and some improvement of her symptoms .
She continued to do quite well with her creatinine lowering finally to 2.8 on 01/04/97 .
The patient was therefore discharged feeling relatively well with her decreased creatinine .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed up by Dr. Na Fongbain and she will also have a HMC two times a day to help her with insulin which she had necessitated since she had been started on Prednisone 60 mg q.d.
The patient is discharged 01/05/97 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a seventy two year old female with multiple cardiac risk factors and Barrett &apos;s esophagitis who was discharged from Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital on Jun 28 , 1999 after admission for chest pain of uncertain etiology , but an exercise tolerance test with Adenosine MIBI showed a mild reversible perfusion defect posterolaterally .
The patient &apos;s medication regimen was augmented .
See details in discharge summary of Jun 26 , to Jun 28 , 1999 .
On Jun 29 , 1999 the patient had her typical tingling across the chest with left arm pain several hours after cleaning house and going out to lunch .
On Jun 30th , the following morning , she wakened with her symptoms , but they progressed to substernal chest pain and nausea .
Nitroglycerin sublingual x three failed to relieve symptoms and she was referred to the nearest emergency room , which was at Lu Son Medical Center hospital .
There her Electrocardiogram was interpreted as showing inferolateral changes .
She was transferred to Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital for cardiac catheterization .
On review of her Electrocardiogram here there did not appear to be a significant changes .
Specifically , the T wave inversion in F was more distinct than on previous Electrocardiogram here , but was in the direction of the R-wave vector .
Other changes were consistent with lead placement .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / FAMILY HISTORY / SOCIAL HISTORY :
See discharge summary of Jun 26 to Jun 28 , 1999 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , Transderm nitro .1 milligrams / hour .
Aspirin ( on hold pending repeat EGD ) , Lipitor 20 milligrams po q p.m. , nitroglycerin sublingual PRN , Premarin .9 milligrams a day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. for seven days .
ALLERGIES :
Ampicillin associated with hives , Detrol may have caused fluid retention , calcium channel blockers avoided because of Barrett &apos;s esophagitis .
SBE prophylaxis for mild MR an AI .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 152/50 , heart rate 80 , respirations 15 , temperature 97.7 , carotids II+ without bruits , no jugular venous distention , lungs clear , core regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Extremity pulses all intact , 1+ ankle edema .
Neurologic intact .
LABORATORY :
Sodium 134 , potassium 4.3 , Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm with normal intervals , non-specific T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Impression was of a chest pain again with typical and atypical features in a patient with coronary artery disease documented by stress test with MIBI , multiple cardiac risk factors and Barrett &apos;s esophagitis .
Dr. Barrett was consulted for an opinion in fact whether it was warranted to proceed with cardiac catheterization given the overall picture as well as the patient &apos;s reluctance due to her sister &apos;s recently having had an acute myocardial infarction while undergoing cardiac catheterization .
On Barrett &apos;s recommendation , cardiac catheterization was performed .
Angiogram showed entirely clear coronary arteries with a right dominant system .
It was concluded that the patient &apos;s chest pain was esophageal in origin . ( Interestingly , her sister who had the myocardial infarction during cardiac catheterization also had an angiogram showing clear coronaries according to the patient ) .
The patient was still awaiting her esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Dr. Gootzfrier .
Results were discussed with the patient and her ongoing therapy reviewed .
In view of the catheterization results , the patient opted to discontinue her Lipitor for now .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Chest pain with reversible defect on recent exercise tolerance test Adenosine MIBI and normal coronary angiography .
Other diagnoses as in past medical history ( see discharge summary of 6/26 to 6/28/99 ) .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , Premarin .9 milligrams po q d , Prilosec 20 milligrams po b.i.d. ( increased for possible esophageal of chest pain ) .
Discontinued nitroglycerin , Aspirin and Lipitor .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted , diet was cautiously advanced .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained and GI was consulted who recommended observation .
The following day , the patient &apos;s fevers had resolved and the jaundice was additionally resolving .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
30 WEEKS GESTATION , PREMATURE LABOR STATUS POST CESAREAN SECTION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida-2 para-0 with a known twin gestation with an estimated date of confinement of 02/27/98 .
On the day of admission , the patient had an ultrasound which showed the infants to be in the breech /vertex presentation .
Also noted on ultrasound was a shortened cervix at 1.8 centimeters and funneling of the lower uterine segment .
The patient was admitted to the triage area of labor and delivery and noted to be having contractions every two minutes .
She was given one dose of terbutaline with a subsequent tachycardia to 120 .
She was then started on magnesium sulfate with a 4 gram bolus followed by two grams per hour .
This seemed to decrease the frequency of her contractions significantly and she was only having a rare contraction .
Her cervix on admission was closed and about 80 percent effaced .
She was given betamethasone and transferred to the antenatal unit .
She did well for the first two days with only minor complaints of irregular contractions .
On the morning of 12/24/98 she seemed to be having more contractions and pelvic exam revealed the cervix to be one centimeter , 80 percent effaced .
Consultation was obtained with Dr. Lou who suggested at least briefly increasing the infusion rate to see if her pregnancy could be prolonged longer .
She seemed to respond to this with only irregular contractions .
On the evening of 12/24/98 , the patient once again complained of increasing contraction frequency as well as back pain .
Examination revealed the cervix to now be 2-3 centimeters dilated and the decision was made to discontinue the magnesium and to perform delivery .
She had a primary Cesarean section because of the breech presentation and on Christmas she underwent uncomplicated primary Monroe Kerr Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia .
At 2:10 a.m. on 12/25/98 the patient was delivered of a 3 pound 5 ounce male infant with Apgars of 7 at one and 8 at five minutes .
At 2:12 a.m. on 12/25/98 she was delivered of a male infant weighing 3 pounds and 3 ounces in the vertex position with Apgars of 7 at one and 7 at five minutes .
Both infants were transferred to the Neonatal intensive care unit and were doing well at the time of the maternal discharge .
She did well postoperatively with minimal discomfort .
On the morning of discharge , the patient complained of a warm swollen area on the posterior aspect of her left knee .
Consultation was obtained with the cardiovascular group and the decision was that she had superficial phlebitis of her left leg which could be treated conservatively and would not require Heparin .
The patient was discharged on 12/29/98 and is to be seen in the office in two weeks .
She was discharged with prescriptions for Motrin and Tylenol and Peri-Colace as needed .
She is to attemp elevation , heatetc to her left leg understanding that she will be coming to see her infants in the NICU .

ADMISSION DATE :
06/18/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
06/23/97
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 35-year-old female had a history of bilateral severe hearing loss since the age of four , which worsened several years ago .
This was evaluated by Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint beginning in the early 1990s. The diagnosis of atypical Meniere &apos;s disease was made .
A CT scan without contrast in 1991 was reported to be normal .
She reported there was still some sound perception in the left ear , although it was not useful hearing .
In the right ear , she used a hearing aid , which helped her .
On 5/16/97 , she awakened with tingling and numbness involving first her left arm , then the leg , then the face , associated with mild headache and nausea .
The numbness persisted .
No focal objective neurological deficit was found .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed findings consistent with an acoustic neuroma in the left cerebellar pontine angle extending approximately 3 centimeters into the posterior fossa .
There was a cystic component on the medial superior aspect of the tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
There was severe loss of hearing in both ears .
No other focal neurological deficit was found .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On 6/18/97 , a left suboccipital craniotomy was done , and in conjunction with Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint and Dr. Zette Breunelksbelb , total removal of an acoustic neuroma was accomplished .
The facial nerve was markedly involved with the tumor .
Only a portion of the fibers could be kept intact , and the rest were reapproximated .
Postoperatively , she had complete facial paralysis .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yertrey Sumchirdkaysmavveindreps of the Ocular Plastic Service , and on 6/19/97 , a gold weight was placed in the left upper eyelid .
Her overall course was one of rapid improvement .
There was minimal incoordination of the left upper extremity .
She ambulated initially with help , but this was rapidly improving .
There was no evidence of cerebral spinal fluid leak .
The incision was healing well at the time of discharge .
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
1 ) Left acoustic neuroma .
2 ) Left facial paralysis .
3 ) Atypical Meniere &apos;s disease .

PELVIC :
On tocometer , she had no contractions .
Her fetal heart rates were in the 120s to 140s with good variability and reactive for twin # 3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for rule out preeclampsia .
She had no signs or symptoms of preeclampsia .
Her laboratory values were within normal limits except for uric acid that was 9.2 on admission .
Subsequently her uric acid continued to increase to 10.2 and a 24-hour urine on 9/25/01 revealed 2,518 mg.
Her blood pressure always remained in the mild range and she never was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia .
During this admission she received Betamethasone and was Betamethasone complete on 9/26/01 .

Repeat laboratory values showed improvement in her laboratory data , especially with a decline in her uric acid .
Her blood pressures on postoperative day # 0 were 160s to 170s/70s to 80s and , given her elevated systolic pressure , she was started on Labetolol 100 mg b.i.d.
Her blood pressures ranged between 140s and 160s/70s to 80s and she remained without any symptoms of preeclampsia .
Given that she was in stable condition , ambulating , voiding , tolerating food , and passing flatus by postoperative day # 4 , she was discharged to home .

Pt was admitted to the neurology service for work-up .
As she had been taking ASA prior to admission , Aggrenox was started for secondary prevention .
Homocystine was high at 12 , therefore vitamins B6 , B12 and folate were started ; Cholesterol was high at 259 with an LDL of 192 - a statin was initiated .
Blood pressures were initially allowed to run in the 150s-160s , however at the time of discharge more aggressive BP management is advised , and in addition to her beta-blocker , an ACE-inhibitor was started .
A TTE preliminary read shows an EF of 60% with mild AI , trace MR , trace TR , LVH ; a bubble study was negative .
A 24-hour Holter is pending ; the Pt was in NSR on EKGs , and was ruled-out for MI by cardiac enzymes .
Pt was seen by PT and OT who have recommended acute rehabilitation .
Clinically , the Pt improved during the hospital course , with residual mild R nasolabial fold flattening , 4+/5 strength proximally of the right arm and leg ; she is slightly weaker distally with 3/5 of the interosseous muscles on the right .
IMPRESSION :
This is a 67 y / o woman with poorly controlled HTN , hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism , who presented with a lacunar stroke , most likely due to HTN .
Given her fairly young age , investigation of cardioembolic sources was pursued and not found by TTE , though a Holter report is still pending .
Secondary prevention will include improved BP treatment ( added ACE ) , cholesterol treatment ( added statin ) , treatment of high homocystine with B vitamins , and a switch from ASA to Aggrenox .
She is being discharged to rehab and will F / U in the neurology clinic in 4-6 weeks .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Inferolateral myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
1. Single vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent placement .
2. Coronary angiogram .
3. Right heart cath .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 44 -year-old man with a apical lateral ST elevation myocardial infarction with angioplasty and stenting of the OM-1 , transferred to the Coronary Care Unit .
The patient has no known prior history or cardiac risk factors but awoke at 2 AM with epigastric and chest discomfort which he had before but no associated symptoms .
He went back to sleep without any difficulty but awoke without incident feeling fine .
Prior to going to work at approximately 9 AM , he developed a different type of chest discomfort for which he took Tums .
At work , he continued to have left-sided chest pain with increasing intensity to 5/10 associated with diaphoresis and belching .
He was given Excedrin by a co-worker and ultimately went to Nony Medical Center at 10:30 in the morning where he was noted to have a mm. of ST elevation in 1 and L , as well as V5-V6 with ST depression in V1-V2 .
He was treated with aspirin , nitro , morphine with transient hypotension that responded to an IV bolus of fluid , started on Heparin and transferred emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Ponta,itri- University Medical Center .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was taken directly to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where coronary angiography demonstrated occlusion of a large bifurcating OM1 .
The rest of the coronaries were within normal limits .
The patient underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention of the bifurcating OM1 using a kissing balloon technique followed by stenting of the lower division of the OM .
This was an excellent angiographic outcome .
The patient received a bolus of Reopro followed by constant infusion and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit .
There , he was continued on aspirin , Reopro , Heparin , nitroglycerin , beta-blocker and folate , and a hypercoag panel was sent .
He did well overnight in the Coronary Care Unit with no further chest pain or shortness of breath .
Plavix was added to the patient &apos;s regimen , and he was tolerating his anti-ischemic regimen well and the beta-blocker was advanced and consideration was made for starting ACE inhibitor as well .
The patient &apos;s creatine kinase peaked at 3765 with 12% MB , and for markedly elevated triglycerides , he was started on Lopid .
He did well in the Coronary Care Unit and was ultimately deemed stable for transfer to the Step Down Unit for the remainder of his post-myocardial infarction care .
His beta-blocker was advanced .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 56% .
He was tolerating the addition of ACE inhibitor , was ambulating without symptoms , beta-blocker was advanced and he was ultimately deemed stable for discharge .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on 8/16/04 where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with attempted repair of a perirenal aortic aneurysm which was subsequently aborted given the patient &apos;s complex aortic anatomy and the extensive scar encountered .
The patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
Please see operative note for more details .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .
The patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .
This was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .
The patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .
This was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .
However , on the morning of 9/5/04 the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .
The patient was intubated and placed on pressors after administration of the ACLS protocol .
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .
After his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .
Cardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .
Decision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .
Multiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .
After extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .
The patient &apos;s daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .
Despite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on 9/5/04 .
The family was at the bedside at this time .
The medical examiner has been contacted and a post has been requested .

ATTENDING :
CRILI THONTA TLANDBINDE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Miller-Fisher variant Guillain Barre syndrome .
Sixth nerve palsy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 45-year-old male who complained of a 2-day history of horizontal diplopia that began in rightward gaze and was now present bilaterally .
Of note , the patient reports a 2-week history of upper respiratory infection and sinus congestion .
He reports that the day before admission , he awoke with diplopia that did resolve with monocular vision .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient had pupils that were equal , round , and reactive to light bilaterally .
Accommodation was intact .
Visual fields were full by confrontation .
Of note , there was right than greater than left abducens weakness noted by the physical examiner on admission .
His strength in his extremities was normal and he had normal reflexes .
MRI of the brain demonstrated significant right sphenoid maxillary and ethmoid sinus inflammation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Procedures :
The patient was evaluated initially by the Otolaryngology Service with the consideration that his right-sided sinus disease was contributing to his sixth nerve palsy .
He was started on antibiotic treatment for his sinus findings .
However , further review by Neurology Consult Service indicated that the sinus disease was likely not sufficient to explain the patient &apos;s cranial nerve findings .
The working diagnosis at that point was the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome versus less likely causes .
The patient underwent lumbar puncture and also had an electromyelogram performed .
EMG findings were in fact consistent with variant Guillain-Barre syndrome .
It was then determined that the patient should be started on intravenous immunoglobulin .
He was therefore started with a treatment course of 6 days of IV IgA after obtaining an IgA level .
The patient tolerated this treatment course well .
His cranial neuropathy was monitored carefully and was found to be stable to slightly improving in the first several days of treatment .
He was also treated with IV steroids .
By 08/20/2003 , the patient has tolerated the full treatment course and had a substantial improvement in his diplopia .
It was then determined that the patient was safe to discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain .
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOW UP :
The plan for follow up was with Dr. Viennee Breutzfreierm within 14 days of discharge .

UNIT NUMBER :

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
05/22/2003
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
#1. Malignant neoplasm of the esophagus .
#2. Chronic blood loss anemia .
#3. Secondary malignant neoplasm of the liver .
#4. Secondary malignant neoplasm of the lung .
#5. pulmonary emboli and infarction .
#6. Esophageal hemorrhage .
#7. hypo-osmolality .
#8. Hypertension .
#9. Hypothyroidism .
#10. noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
#11. Adult failure to thrive .
PROCEDURE :
Radiotherapy to the esophagus on 5/13/03 for four consecutive days .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several admissions for this 72 year-old female with metastatic unresectable esophageal cancer who is admitted with generalized upper abdominal pain of several days duration .
We have been seeing her fairly frequently in clinic , trying to give her some palliative chemotherapy which did not seem to work ( platinum and 5FU ) and she has had an anemia requiring transfusions on a regular basis every few weeks with heme positive stools .
On the days leading up to her admission she had not had many bowel movements but forced one with laxatives the night before admission .
The abdominal pain was slightly better after defecation but was not really influenced much by position or eating .
The bowel movement was dark .
She had nausea .
She was regurgitating some of her saliva from the lesion in her esophagus that was preventing her from swallowing .
She had some dyspnea that was continuing in spite of transfusions .
Her exam showed a blood pressure of 126/68 , heart rate 72 and regular , temperature 98.8 .
Her pain level was rated a 5 out of 10 .
She was pale and exhausted .
Old ecchymoses from a recent fall were resolving on her face and the laceration on her nasal bridge was also covered with scab .
Her tongue was moist .
Her JVP was less than 6 cm .
Her lungs were clear .
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base .
Her abdomen was softly protuberant .
There was a few tingling bowel sounds .
The liver is 10 below the right costal margin at the MCL , firm and tender .
No hepatic rub .
Rectal ; good tone , empty vault but the material present is dark brown and guaiac positive .
Neuro exam ; positive for generalized weakness / deconditioning , but cranial nerves and mentation were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included an abdominal film that showed nonspecific gas pattern .
Her sodium was 130 , potassium 4.2 , her BUN was 27 , creatinine 0.8 .
Her plasma glucose was 409 , her albumin 1.6 .
Her alk phos 816 .
ALT 53 , AST 113 , LDH 699 , white blood count was 17.3 with 85 polys , 12 lymphs , no bands .
Her crit was 21.6 and her platelets were 100,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought into the hospital and begun on IV fluids along with some clear liquids if she could tolerate them and her condition did not really improve , although she would keep reporting that each day she was a little bit better .
She was really too weak to get out of bed .
She only picked at her food and still had some dysphagia for solids .
Because of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusions , we suspected that the esophageal lesion itself was probably the source of this bleeding and perhaps some palliative radiation therapy would both open the sphincter area for swallowing and staunch the bleeding .
To that end , external beam radiation therapy was begun and she tolerated it fairly well .
Some episodes of nausea , but only received about four or five doses of it without any marked change in how she felt .
Over this period of time , there has been tentative plans to try to get her closer to home to the Lida Shonic,nsol Memorial Hospital home or even to her own home , to be able to died in her own bed but this was not possible because the family felt uncertain about being able to provide enough safe care for her , even for a brief period of time .
Ultimately she became jaundiced and encephalopathic and the decision was to let her stay in the hospital .
She had previously established that she did not want resuscitation or intubation and this was abided by and she passed away in her sleep at 6:45 am on 5/22/03 .
The family was not interested in having an autopsy .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12-6-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
12-9-93
IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. He is a 77 year old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .
The initial presentation was the orifice of the right upper lobe with mediastinoscopy positive for subcarinal lymph node .
He received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam .
Subsequently , he returned to Goo where he received another 3,000 rads via an endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence .
Over the pat three to four weeks , he started having increased dyspnea and noted wheezing .
A bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the tumor into the right main stem bronchus with a positive needle biopsy , washings and brushings for squamous cell carcinoma .
A computerized tomography scan showed a large subcarinal mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history was significant for malignant bladder tumor in 1991 .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , Mr. He had very marked inspiratory and expiratory stridor .
There were no nodes present .
The breath sounds were somewhat decreased through both lung fields .
His cardiac examination did not show any murmur , gallop , or cardiomegaly .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly , and no peripheral edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A bronchoscopy with the intention of coring out tumor was carried out by Dr. Reg He , but all the tumor was extrinsic to the airway and he was unable to relieve the obstruction .
The tumor now involves the trachea as well as the right main bronchus .
His major complaint was of persistent severe coughing and secretions .
Ultimately , only codeine at 30 mg q6h controlled him and this was very affective .
Inhalers provide only mild relief .
He is aware of his prognosis .
The patient was also seen by Dr. Lenchermoi Fyfesaul of the Oncology Service who did not feel that chemotherapy had anything of promise to offer .
Mr. He is an anxious man , but very pleasant .
He and his family understand his prognosis .

AORTIC STENOSIS .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
4-1-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
4-13-93
DIAGNOSES :
Aortic stenosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .
4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .
This involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .
He did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .
He underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .
Following this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .
Over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .
He also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was referred here for further evaluation .
Mr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .
The blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .
There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .
There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .
The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .
There was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .
The liver was not palpable .
There were diminished pulses in the legs .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .
The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
I indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .
Accordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .
The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .
Using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .
The left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .
An attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .
On April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .
At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .
There was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .
I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .
The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .
The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .
Mr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .
Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .
He had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .
He seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .
There was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .
The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .
The heart appeared to be flaccid .
We really have no good explanation of what this was all about .
He was being treated for a possible pneumonia .
He did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .
The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .
A post mortem examination will be performed .

CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &apos;s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient &apos;s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient &apos;s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

Hepatocellular carcinoma , and hepatitis C .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Liver transplant .
Native hepatectomy .
Re-exploration for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear .
He had no appreciable ascites .
He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema .
He was Neurologically intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
bilirubin to be .6 .
SGOT of 80 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Epistaxis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis , tricuspid regurgitation , heart failure , chronic atrial fibrillation , chronic ventricular ectopy , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis on Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Partial embolization of blood supply to nose , 8/22 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female has rheumatic heart disease .
Mitral and possibly tricuspid valve surgery is scheduled for Labor Day by Dr. Riemund C. Kennedy .
Her history is detailed in the discharge summary of August 10 of this year .
She is admitted now for a neuro-interventional radiology procedure to decrease the likelihood of epistaxis on Coumadin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Chest was clear .
Right neck and right groin catheterization sites were benign .
No edema .
Examination was otherwise unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit was 42 , PT was 10 , potassium was 3.6 , BUN was 29 , creatinine was 1.4 , blood sugar was 111 .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , right ventricular hypertrophy , right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The interventional neuro-radiology procedure was performed by Dr. A Skizeis , on August 22 , via the right femoral artery .
The right internal maxillary artery supply to the nasal mucosa was embolized .
The left external carotid artery was occluded at its origin , with collaterals from the internal carotid artery .
Thus , embolization on the left side was not possible .
The patient received Coumadin , 10 mg. , on the evening following the procedure , and is discharged the next day .
Her prothrombin time will be rechecked on August 27 by her primary care physician , Dr. Naka Gift .
Once her prothrombin time is in therapeutic range , she will be observed for epistaxis .
She will take her last dose of Coumadin on September 1 in anticipation of cardiac surgery .
If her prothrombin time does not come into therapeutic range promptly , then surgery may be delayed .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tricuspid regurgitation , heart failure , chronic atrial fibrillation , chronic ventricular ectopy , chronic obstructive lung disease .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization 11/03 .
OTHER PROCEDURE :
Pulmonary function test 11/04 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 .
Neck veins distended .
Carotids normal .
Chest clear .
Apical impulse not palpable .
Right ventricular heave .
S1 normal .
S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 .
No S3 or opening snap .
Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Diastolic rumble at the apex .
Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged .
Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses .
Superficial varicose veins .
No edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction .
Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .

ultrasound and guided paracentesis was done on 4/14/92 .
Barium enema showed a large amount of stool in the colon without sign of obstruction on 4/17/92 .
Gaited blood pool scan on 4/18/92 shows slight decrease left ventricular function with an LVEF of 45% , minimal wall motion abnormalities confined to a small zone of the apex .
Persantine Thallium study , no definite evidence of ischemia or infarction .
Abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography showed cirrhotic liver with markedly enlarged portal vein and recannulization of the umbilical vein prominent acidic fluid in the abdomen , moderate splenomegaly , right renal cyst , status post hysterectomy .
electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia , first degree AV block , left axis deviation .
At the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for two days and then switched to Unasyn 3 grams per day .
The patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy .
The patient was evaluated for long term therapy .
The patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with Aldactone and Lasix .
Marked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several days .
Because of the patient &apos;s history of asystole , she was discussed with Dr. White as a possible transplant candidate .
He felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out .
For that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45% ejection fraction .
A Persantine Thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia .
Her diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting .
The patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by Dr. White , who felt , although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function .
An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4/23/92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus .
Meanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells , with no preponderance of polys .
The patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds .
At the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued , and an optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to be between 126 and 128 .
This period of time there was a brief increase in her SGOT from the 100 &apos;s to 230 .
She was discharged home on 5/5/92 on the following program .
1600 calorie ADA diet .
No free water , no added salt , 60 gram protein diet .
Tegretol 200 mg. d , 6 units NPH and 10 units CZI qam .
OsCal 1 twice a day , Aldactone 25 mg. , Lasix 20 mg.
every other day , vitamin D 5000 units per week , quinine 300 mg. qhs , Lactulose 30 cc. tid and Omiprazol 20 qhs .

An I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .
The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Cocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Peritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .
COMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :
Neck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
None .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was discharged to Samfer Street with no autopsy .

The patient had o.d. glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on May 12th , 1992 .
Soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak .
She was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident .
She has absolutely no neurologic disease in past .
The review of systems is negative .
However , two days prior to admission , one family member noted that the patient had a transient left facial droop .
A potassium three days prior to surgery was 2.8 , the level being normalized with p.o. kay ciel prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 , no angina before or after .
She had a normal exercise thallium test in 08/89 , per Ona Hospital .
The phone no. at the Ona Hospital is 337-4296 , 936 area code .
# 2. History of M. kansasaii with workup by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital proceeding currently .

Albumin 2.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .
The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .
This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .
The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .
Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .
Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .
Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .
It is discontinued at the time of transport .
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient &apos;s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .
I will be happy to furnish the results .
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
It has been evaluated in the past without success .
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .
The patient has glaucoma .
Her medications are as listed below .
Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .
His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .

SECONDARY PROCEDURES :
12/20/92 - Mr. Head underwent bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasounds which showed no evidence for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital preoperative exam .
His total estimated blood loss for the operation was 3,070 cc , of which 1,970 cc was weighed on the sponges , 700 cc was in the suction , and 400 cc was estimated from the fields .
For replacement he received 500 cc of autologous packed cells , 2,250 cc of albumen and 2400 cc of lactated ringer solutions .
In the recovery room his hemivac drained 350 cc over 4 hours .
His labs in the recovery room showed a white blood count of 9.9 , hematocrit 29.5 , and a platelet count of 183,000 .
His prothrombin time was 11.3 , and partial thromboplastin time of 31.4 .

He was transferred an additional unit of autologous packed cells in the recovery room and an additional unit of autologous blood was hung to be transfused on the floor .
Over the next 24 hours , his hemivac drain put out small amounts of serous sanguinous fluid , and was removed without difficulty .
He was transfused 1 additional unit of banked blood the evening of surgery .
He underwent serial hematocrit determinations throughout the rest of the hospital stay .
On postoperative day 1 , his hematocrit was 29.1 , the next day it was 26.5 .
On 12/19 , his hematocrit stabilized at 29.6 , and he received no additional transfusion .
For management of pain postoperatively , he was placed on the PCA Morphine pump .
This provided excellent relief of his incisional pain .
He was gradually weaned off the intravenous Morphine , and switched over to oral analgesics with good control of his pain .
Prior to discharge , he was switched over to Percocet , which provided excellent relief of his pain , and he was discharged with a prescription for Percocet .
Postoperatively , he was placed in balance suspension , and kept at bedrest for two days when he was then mobilized , and started gait training , using a walker , and then crutches .
Prior to discharge , he was independent in ambulation with crutches , as well as transfers .
With the history of electrocardiogram changes in the recovery room , the patient was seen in consult by Dr. Lako Head , of Cardiology .
Dr. Head found the at the electrocardiogram was consistent , but not diagnostic with mild ischemia .
The patient has had no prior history of coronary artery disease , and the absence of significant ST depressions , he found the findings of only mild concern .
Patient was placed on Nitropace 1/2 &quot; q6h .
He was placed on the cardiac monitor for 36 hours , and had CPK isoenzyme determinations .
The patient &apos;s electrocardiogram returned to normal , he had no evidence or episodes , of ischemia or chest pain , in the perioperative , his CPK and isoenzymes showed no evidence of myocardial infarction .
Nitropace was discontinued on 12/17/92 , and the patient was cleared by Dr. Head , and no further Cardiology followup was required .
Mr. Head &apos;s wound was checked daily , and found to be healing well without evidence for infection .
On postoperative day number 10 , 2 days after the patient was discharged , the patient returned to the hospital for staple removal .
The staples were removed , and steri strips were applied .
The wound was found healing by primary intention , without evidence for infection .
For prophylaxis against infection Mr. Head was placed on Ancef perioperatively .
This was continued for 72 hours postoperatively .
For prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis , he was placed on Coumadin perioperatively .
His daily dosage was adjusted according to his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time .
On postoperative day number 2 his prothrombin time was 13.3 , and partial thromboplastin time was 39.0 , and he received 5 mg of Coumadin .
On postoperative day 3 , his prothrombin time was 14.9 , and his partial thromboplastin time was 40.6 , and he received 4 mg of Coumadin .
On 12/20/92 , he underwent bilateral venous ultrasound of the lower extremities .
This was negative for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally .
His Coumadin was discontinued .
Mr. Head required intermittent straight cath for the first 48 hours postoperatively .
Urine was sent for urinalysis , and culture and sensitivity , with this straight catheterization , and the urine culture and the urinalysis were negative .
He was continued on intravenous Ancef for a total of 72 hours postoperatively , to cover him for the intermittent catheterizations .
About 36 hours postoperatively , the patient was able to void spontaneously , and there no further intermittent catheterizations were required .
Mr. Head continued to progress well with his physical therapy .

ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain .
His vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .
The carotids were without bruits .
Crackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left .
Cardiovascular exam :
S3 and S4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .
The point of maximal impulse was not palpable .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities :
within normal limits .
The neurological examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , BUN and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 .
The urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells .
Admission chest X-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic T &apos;s in I , IV , V1 and T2 .
ST depression and biphasic T &apos;s were noted in V3 through V6 .
No Q waves were noted .
Picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .
He underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .
He also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .
The renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .
The impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient &apos;s renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .
No evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .
On 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .
Mr. Ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the Cardiology , Renal , and Diabetes and Cardiac Surgery Services .
The patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 &apos;s and was placed on Captopril , 6.25 mg PO t.i.d.
His blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his Captopril was discontinued .
His renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his BUN and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .
Dr. Freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient &apos;s acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .
On the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor , without incident .
He did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures .
The patient is being transferred to Nacalv Medical Center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well .
His saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his stitches and staples will remain in to be removed during his postoperative office visit .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
NPH 12 units and regular CZI 25 units qa.m. , CZI sliding scale prn , Digoxin .125 mg PO q.day , Ecotrin , 1 PO q.day , Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg PO q.day , Reglan 10 mg PO t.i.d. , Synthroid 0.5 mg PO q.day , Lasix 40 mg PO q.day , potassium chloride prn .
Dr. Kotekeese , the patient &apos;s diabetes consultant , noted that the patient &apos;s morning regular insulin was new , and suggested that a premixed NPH regular 70/30 insulin might prove to be appropriate for him .
The patient &apos;s diet is a no added salt / no concentrated sweets diet .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Bun and with Dr. Shufffyfe .

include hiatus hernia with Barrett &apos;s esophagus , pseudo-gout , and dilated cardiomyopathy with history of intra-atrial thrombus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Undergone during this hospital admission was a left brachial artery embolectomy .
The patient also underwent upper endoscopy and a left wrist fine needle aspiration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white male with a probable brachial artery embolism .
The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation .
He was previously on Coumadin because of a prior embolic cerebrovascular accident .
The patient had his Coumadin discontinued in January 1992 secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed .
The patient was swimming at 4:00 o &apos;clock this afternoon when he experienced left upper extremity pain and paralysis .
He was evaluated at Sephsandpot Center and referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for evaluation .
The patient is righthanded .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. cardiomyopathy .
2. atrial fibrillation .
3. upper gastrointestinal bleed in January of 1992 complicating his Coumadin treatment .
The Coumadin was discontinued .
4. cerebrovascular accident in 1988 with a residual aphasia .
5. polycythemia vera .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Is none .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Isordil , Ditropan , Cytotec and Ecotrin .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
( at time of admission ) the systolic blood pressure is 180 , his head and neck examination within normal limits .
Cardiac :
he has a II out of VI systolic ejection murmur which is loudest at the right upper sternal border .
His chest is clear .
His abdomen was benign .
His rectal examination guaiac negative .
Of greatest note on his pulse examination :
his carotid , femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2 plus both right and left .
His subclavian artery and axillary artery pulses are 2 plus bilaterally .
His brachial pulse is 2 plus , radial pulse 2 plus and ulnar pulse 2 plus on the right .
On the left he has no brachial , no radial and no ulnar pulse .
His left hand and arm strength is 4/4 with decreased sensation in the left fingers in the median and ulnar distribution .
The impression :
a probable brachial artery embolus .
The plan is to perform an urgent embolectomy .
The risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent has been obtained .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room .
The preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .
The postoperative diagnosis , the same .
The procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .
The surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .
The findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .
There were no complications .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .
On postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .
He was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .
In addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .
The patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .
His assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .
He recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .
These recommendations were already underway .
Consequently we simply continued our management .
The cardiology consult also spoke to the patient &apos;s primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .
On 5-30-92 the patient &apos;s gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .
Dr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe &apos;s old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .
During this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .
He had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .
Follow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .
There was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .
The stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .
From Dr. Blood &apos;s standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .
We discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood &apos;s earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .
It was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .
That was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .
Given the patient &apos;s history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .
The findings were as follows .
The principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .
The principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center &apos;s esophagus distally .
In the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .
There were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .
The overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett &apos;s esophagus .
No biopsy was taken .
The biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .
On 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .
Findings were :
there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .
There was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .
There was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .
The aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .
There was trace aortic insufficiency .
The aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .
The left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .
There was trace tricuspid insufficiency .
There was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .
There was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .
There was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .
The patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .
He had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .
On 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .
He confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .
The Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .
Joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .
Joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .
The rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .
A wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .
The patient &apos;s pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .
He is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .
Today , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .
Yesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .
Today his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .
Consequently , he is ready for discharge today .
The only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d.
Ditropan 5 mg. po q.i.d.
Cimetidine 400 mg. PO b.i.d.
Omeprazole 20 mg. PO b.i.d.
Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d.
Percocet 1 tablet po q. 4 to 6 hours prn and Coumadin 5 mg. po q.day .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged to home today 9-1-25 .
His plans for follow up include a return to the Maza Alllarow Healthcare Surgery Clinic on 6-21-92 , that is two and a half weeks from the day of discharge ( 6-4-92 ) .
He is to see his primary medical doctor , Dr. Telshey Swatlleebtik in Ki Ave , Sapo on Tuesday , June 7 , 1992 , that is this coming Tuesday .
It has been a pleasure serving Mr. Flytheleungfyfe and taking care of him .
He is a very pleasant gentleman and it has also been a pleasure to deal with his primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood who is very accessible .

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
05/30/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
06/23/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
(1) stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
(1) right lower lobe pneumonia .
(2) failure to thrive ;
(3) obstructive uropathy .
IDENTIFYING DATA AND CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Mrs. Saujule T. Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .
At that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .
The admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .
The patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .
One month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .
Thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .
This course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .
On 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .
An abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .
Bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .
Two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .
She was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .
On this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .
She was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as detailed above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
She is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .
ALLERGIES :
She is allergic to shellfish .
DRUG ALLERGIES :
She has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .
She was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .
Head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .
She had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .
Abdomen :
showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
Pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .
The patient was occult blood negative .
Extremities :
showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .
However , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .
I and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .
Chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .
IN SUMMARY :
The patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .
She also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .
It was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .
Laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .
Urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .
In view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .
Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .
Renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .
Dr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .
He requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .
Neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .
In view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .
As a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .
The patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .
She was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .
Sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .
On the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .
Her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .
However , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .
On 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .
Her Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .
On June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .
She was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .
In view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .
On 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .
Urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .
A Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .
An electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .
No computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .
She continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .
Off her Ifex the patient &apos;s sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .
For this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .
The mucosa appeared to be preserved .
In addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .
The patient &apos;s white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .
The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .
Her sensorium had cleared .
Because of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .
The patient &apos;s white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .
In addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .
She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .
Despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .
A Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .
On conservative therapy the patient &apos;s nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .
A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .
On 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .
And she was not given platelets in addition .
Throughout this period the patient &apos;s pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .
After much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .
On August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .
On June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .
The PEG tube was found to be draining well .
She was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .
In addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .
The patient &apos;s prognosis is guarded .
Her current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.
She will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .
The patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .
In addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .
FOLLOW-UP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .

Ms. Tikrhalt is an 86 year old female , previously healthy , who presents with a 3 month history of dysphagia .
A subsequent workup including upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computerized tomography scan suggested the presence of a gastric mass .
Endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma .
She reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months .
She denies any abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for an appendectomy in the distant past , cholecystectomy in the past , history of of Cesarean section in the past and a history of near total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Her only medication is Thyrolar for her relative hypothyroidism following resection .
There is a question of an allergy to Tylenol .
She denies any history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease .
Interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma .
She is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress .
Her sclera were nonicteric .
Her oropharynx was clear .
Her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her cardiac examination was unremarkable .
Examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses .
There were multiple well healed surgical scars .
She was guaiac negative .
There was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted .
Her pulses were intact throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and BUN of 19 .
Her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 .
Her Bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively .
Her alkaline phosphatase was 134 .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes .
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable .
The assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient &apos;s nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Bactrim , single strength , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , initiated 8/27/92 , Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day , Ferrous Gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day .

Mediastinal tumor mass .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of colon cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity , hypertension , history of myocardial infarction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
January 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &apos;s grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Levoxine 0.125 mg PO q.day , Vasotec 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Maxzide 75/50 , 30 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to sulfa .
HABITS :
50 pack year smoking history , still smoking currently .
Ethanol :
none .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular .
Chest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base .
She has a previous right mastectomy .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop .
Abdomen :
obese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The neurological examination is nonfocal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .

DISCHARGE DATE :
12-04-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
hepatic cyst .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. history of colon cancer ,
2. elevated carcinoembryogenic antigen .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
11-28-92 , exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions , biopsy of lymph nodes and small bowel mesentery and intraoperative ultrasound .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old female , status post a right colectomy for colon cancer , now with some question of hepatic metastases .
She has received postoperative chemotherapy .
She has had some right sided abdominal pain and apparently had a computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study at an outside hospital that showed a question of hepatic metastases .
She was referred to Dr. Duhenile and is now scheduled for ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging study , angiography and possible surgical resection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
1. status post right colectomy ,
2. status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy ,
3. status post appendectomy ,
4. status post mastectomy ,
5. myocardial infarction in 1983 .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to sulfa .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Mevacor ,
2. Thyroxine ,
3. Maxzide .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is a nondrinker and has a 30 pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , her vital signs included a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure of 122/72 , heart rate of 100 , she was in no respiratory distress .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :
no scleral icterus .
Her neck was supple , no adenopathy .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , obese , well healed incisions , no hepatomegaly .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for a hematocrit of 41.8 , white blood count of 7.0 , alkaline phosphatase 133 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.2 , prothrombin time 9.4 , partial thromboplastin time of 25.0 .
The admission chest X-ray showed bilateral apical calcific densities that were felt to be consistent with granulomas .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent abdominal ultrasound , which was more consistent with a cystic lesion .
She also had a magnetic resonance imaging study , which suggested cyst or hemangioma .
However , a computerized tomography scan suggested a solid mass .
Given the uncertainty , decision was made to proceed with angiography and exploration to resolve the issue .
A mesenteric angiogram on 11-27-92 demonstrated no variant anatomy , the venous phase being okay , and no other abnormalities .
On 11-28-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy , total mobilization of the liver with intraoperative ultrasound , resection of fat necrosis of the small bowel mesentery and extensive lysis of adhesions .
Dr. Besti Kotebreun of the Radiology Service performed intraoperative ultrasound , and carefully looked at the entire liver .
The mass that had been seen on computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study proved to be a simple cyst and the rest of the liver looked perfectly normal .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively had a relatively uneventful course .
She was advanced slowly to a regular diet .
She did have some persistent fever after the operation with a white blood count in the 14-15,000 range and on the day of discharge , her temperature was in the 101 range .
She said that she routinely runs fevers to 101 or 102 at home and has for years , and insisted upon going home .
This seemed reasonable given there was no identifiable source for a fever at the time of discharge and she promised close follow up for any problems .
It should be noted that her CEA upon admission was 13.9 , indicating that she must have tumor somewhere .
She underwent a computerized tomography scan of the chest prior to discharge , which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases .
She also underwent a bone scan by Nuclear Radiology , which demonstrated no findings suggestive of metastatic disease .
Her pathology report was as follows :
1. mesenteric nodule was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy ,
2. peripancreatic mesentery , small bowel biopsy was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy , and
3. lymph node excision from the periportal region was no evidence of malignancy .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on 12-04-92 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Percocet , 1-2 PO q4-6h prn .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old Hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease , status post a middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident was admitted for left carotid endarterectomy .
His history of present illness began with a worsening left toe ulcer in 06/93 resulting in a left great toe amputation .
Approximately two days following discharge , his family members noted that his behavior had changed , including personality changes , confusion and self-neglect
On 08/07/93 he was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where an magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a 4 centimeter infarct in the left frontoparietal and temporal areas without evidence of bleeding .
He was noted to have calcified vertebral artery .
His infarct was felt to be consistent with a superior middle cerebral infarct .
At that time Holter monitor showed no abnormalities .
An echocardiogram was reportedly normal and an MRI angiogram documented a 95% occlusion of his left coronary artery .
He was sent home on Coumadin for follow up with Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy and presented on 09/18/93 for his procedure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for five years and peripheral vascular disease , status post a right above knee amputation in 1987 for gangrene and status post his left great toe amputation in 06/93 .

regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and a systolic flow murmur was noted .
His abdomen was reportedly soft , nontender with normoactive bowel sounds .
Extremities showed no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were markedly diminished bilaterally .
Radially the left carotid pulse was felt to be stronger than the right and the left dorsalis pedis pulse was 1+ .
Bilateral carotid bruits were noted as well .
Neurologic exam was notable for disorientation to time , increased tone in his left upper extremity and slight right facial droop and a markedly decreased gag on the right side .
The deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetric .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium of 138 , potassium of 4.4 , chloride of 101 , bicarbonate 30.9 , BUN of 16 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose of 283 , hematocrit of 41.5 , white blood count of 6.7 with 50% polys , 29% lymphs .
Platelet count of 224,000 , prothrombin time of 12.2 , partial thromboplastin time of 30.9 .
His admission electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with PR interval of .14 , QRS of .08 with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities consistent with apical lateral subendocardial ischemia relative to the August 7 , 1993 electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Iron was admitted to the Ossontonville Milt Ywestmeadtl Marlenc Hospital where he underwent preoperative evaluation .
A medical consultation was obtained for his abnormal electrocardiogram with recommendation for a Persantine Thallium study .
On 09/21/93 he underwent a Persantine Thallium study with no complaints of chest pain .
His heart rate went from 70 to 84 , 63% maximal predicted heart rate .
Blood pressure was unchanged .
After Persantine infusion , electrocardiogram showed 1 to 2 millimeter downsloping ST-depressions , V4 through V6 , 0.5 to 1 millimeter ST-depressions in 1 , 2 and AVF .
The changes returned to baseline after intravenous Aminophylline was administered .
The test was felt to be positive for ischemia and Thallium images demonstrated a small amount of inferoapical ischemia as well as left ventricular dilatation upon exercise and normal pulmonary uptake .
On 09/22/93 he underwent an uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was treated intraoperatively with nitroglycerin .
On 09/23 he was noted to have asymptomatic ST-depressions of 1 to 2 millimeters in leads 2 , 3 , F , V2 through V6 .
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CPK &apos;s on nitro paste , oxygen , Metoprolol and aspirin .
The ST-depressions largely resolved .
On 09/26/93 he was transferred to the Medical Service for further evaluation of his cardiovascular status .
A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for maximization of medical regimen and deferring cardiac catheterization at that time .
His course was also remarkable for adjustments in his insulin regimen with difficult control of his glucose and postoperative anemia treated with iron sulfate .
On 09/29/93 he remained hemodynamically stable with his left carotid endarterectomy site healing well .
He was discharged home to follow up with Dr. Tiffill Sapnins of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach of Cardiology .
He was to follow up as well in the H Health Network for postoperative care .

ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOW UP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Dilated cardiomyopathy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right heart catheterization .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .
The patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .
He was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .
After a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .
He was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .
Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for above .
For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .
The patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .
Initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 14 .
Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .
The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .
The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .
There was no S3 gallop .
Abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .
A chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .
The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .
Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .
The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .
Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .
On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient &apos;s right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .
Systemic vascular resistance was 900 .
The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .
Over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .
At discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .
Should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .
The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Lasix 20 mg. q.day .
Isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.
Serevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.
The patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .
Should his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .
Should his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .
FOLLOW UP :
He will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .
In addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .
Over the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .
He has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .
Although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .
The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .
He has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .
He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
On examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
His blood pressure was 110/70 .
Heart was 82 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 16 .
His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .
Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .
The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .
There was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
There was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .
The extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .
The posterior tibialis pulses were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .
Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .
The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .
The ECG was paced .
An outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .
There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .
The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .
Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .
In addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .
The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient &apos;s family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient &apos;s age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .
While in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .
The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .
The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .
In addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .
He will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son &apos;s home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State &apos;s saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d. Pulmacort and Serevent inhalers 2 puffs b.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Prilosec 20 mg. q.d. Colace 100 mg. t.i.d.

Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. Fraction within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

DISCHARGE DATE :
11-4-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
cerebellar hematoma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. deep venous thrombosis ,
2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .
She was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As documented previously in the patient &apos;s medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , she is an elderly woman with labored respirations .
Her blood pressure was 148/65 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , temperature was afebrile .
Her head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination showed normocephalic , atraumatic head , oropharynx was clear , her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
II / VI systolic ejection murmur .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities :
2+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities .
Her neurological examination revealed that she was awake and alert at the time of her arrival to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and was moving all extremities to commands with pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation .
Her extra ocular movements were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine of 27 and 1.1 , electrocardiogram which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with T wave inversions in V2 through V6 .
The chest X-ray showed a left pleural effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and given her history of variably responsive state , and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .
It was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .
However , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .
The patient tolerated the initial procedure well .
On the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .
She was awake and following commands .
It was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient &apos;s age and past medical history .
The patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .
She did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .
Her subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .
In addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .
She is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .
She has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .
On 10-28-93 , the patient &apos;s course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .
She had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .
Since that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .
Her current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .
Her prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .
The patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .
We feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .
Her dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .
Other medications include :
Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .
The patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .
Additionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is transferred to Villrow Health .
She should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks &apos; time for follow up evaluation .
She should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks &apos;time .
She will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Relapsed extensive staged small cell lung carcinoma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
VRE positive and do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Single is a 58 year old gentleman with a long standing smoking history who was diagnosed with an extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma involving his liver and his lungs in April 2000 .
He was treated with Carboplatin and Etoposide for six cycles and achieved a near complete response .
Re-staging scans in September 2000 demonstrated complete resolution of his lung and mediastinal disease and a 90% reduction in his liver metastases .
His severe abdominal pain had markedly improved and he was asymptomatic while taking narcotics for analgesia .
He presented to the emergency department of Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the day of admission with a three day history of severe abdominal pain .
He did not have nausea and vomiting , constipation or diarrhea .
He had run out of his narcotics for approximately three days .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated extensive hepatic metastases consistent with relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma .
His mental status quickly deteriorated after beginning on his standard doses of Fentanyl patch and a head computerized tomography scan was obtained .
This demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in all lobes of the brain .
There was no hemorrhage seen .
He was started on steroids and began radiation therapy .
His abdominal pain was easily controlled with narcotics and his neurological deficits persisted although they did improve somewhat , once starting steroids .
Of note , he has an ataxic gait , he has periodic lapses in concentration , and he has dysphonia but no evidence of frank aspiration while he is eating his meals .
Initially , he had an expressive aphasia , but this seems to have resolved somewhat .
Other staging scans , including bone scan and chest computerized tomography scan were unremarkable for metastases in his bone but there are three new right lower lobe pulmonary nodules .
After discussion of findings of relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma with the patient he agreed to do not resuscitate / do not intubate status .
Our treatment plan of steroids and radiation therapy is to palliate his symptoms and try to improve his baseline .
These were discussed with Mr. Be &apos;s children as well and everyone is in agreement with this plan .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Otherwise unremarkable .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 4 mg. q6 hours , this may be given PO or intravenous .

LABORATORY DATA :
Unremarkable with a creatinine of 0.6 and normal glucose .
Calcium 8.8 , phosphate 2.9 , magnesium 1.8 , normal liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase is 112 .
Bilirubins are normal .
Coagulation times are normal .
The white blood count is 15,000 , hematocrit 40% , platelet count 300,000 .
Urinalysis is unremarkable .
DISPOSITION :
To Nacalv Medical Center to complete his whole brain XRT .
Ten fractions were planned and currently he is on day #6 .
His code status is do not resuscitate / do not intubate .

The neurological examination :
post angiogram her eyes were closed .
She was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely .
She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .
She maintained her fixation on the conversation well .
The cranial nerve exam :
pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .
Right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .
The left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .
Disks were flat .
Sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .
Seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .
Soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .
Tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .
Sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .
Motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .
Quadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right .
Gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .
Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient &apos;s baseline .
CK &apos;s were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .
A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .

NON-Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
10-24-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&apos;s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

7/30/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
8/9/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lower gastrointestinal bleed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .
He was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .
On the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.
He was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .
He was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .
HE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .
An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .
It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .
The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .
He was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .
Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which gives him a rash .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .
His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .
On cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .
He had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .
On lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .
On rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .
His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .
The chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .
He had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .
The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .
On hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .
The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .
The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .
On the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .
The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .
After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .
On the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .
However , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .
The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .
On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .
Once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .
An echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .
On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .
He was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient &apos;s course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .
The patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .
He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .
He did not have chest pain .
There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .
The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .
Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .
These findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .
Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .
The patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
2-23-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
2-24-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Deep venous thrombosis of right lower extremity .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic melanoma .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is the second Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital admission for Taroby Patient , a 70 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma .
His melanoma was originally diagnosed last fall when he presented with lesions in the liver and spleen , and a chest CT showed left upper lobe nodules .
A head CT scan was negative , but an MRI scan of the spine showed an L5 metastasis with a fracture and had with epidural and paraspinal extension .
In addition , there was a T11 metastasis with cord compression .
Approximately one week ago , he was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for chemotherapy with DTIC and Tamoxifen .
At that time , he also began radiation therapy to his lumbosacral spine .
He is continuing on the radiation therapy to date .
On February 23 , Mr. Patient presented to Dr. Patient &apos;s office with two major symptoms .
First , he had right lower extremity swelling and lower extremity noninvasives confirmed the diagnosis of a femoral deep venous thrombosis .
Second , he had a witnessed episode in which his eyes rolled to the back of his head and there was a question of some seizure activity .
In the past , he has not been known to have a history of CNS metastases .
The episode of potential seizure activity occurred in the setting of a bowel movement and may have been associated with vasovagal activity .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma .
Recently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .
Plain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .
The bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Note :
past medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .
The patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .
He had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .
On physical examination , vital signs were as above .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .
The abdomen was benign with no masses felt .
Cardiovascular exam :
grade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .
The rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .
Extremities :
within normal limits .
The neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .
Cerebellar function was normal .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .
During this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .
A computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .
Bone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .
There was microvascular disease .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .
Spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .
The magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .
There was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .
The first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .
This was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .
The chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .
Thus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .
Actually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .
On that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .
By 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .
The patient &apos;s course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .
He is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .
He continued to have nausea and vomiting .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .
Eventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .
Two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .
It was felt that endoscopy would be of value .
A central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .
After neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .
This was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .
Cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .
The patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .
Gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .
He was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .
He received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.
The only problem was some recurrent nausea .
The radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .
His white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,
2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,
3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,
4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,
5. hypertension .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .
The patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .
The patient is on diet as tolerated .
There will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Right thyroid papillary carcinoma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Pulmonary and right iliac bone metastases .
2. Eosinophilia .
3. Chronic leg edema .
4. Atrial fibrillation .
5. Congestive heart failure .
6. Left subclavian vein thrombosis .
7. Urinary tract infection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin .
She reports no prior surgical history .
The patient also reports no known drug allergy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone in Leschle Drive , Sonpo , and does not report a smoking or alcohol history .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Lanoxin , 0.25 mg po qd ; Lasix , 20 mg po qd .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .
Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .
She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .
She had no definite S3 .
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .
Her spleen could not be palpated .
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .
Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .
The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .
She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .
Arrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .
The prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .

Recurrent ventricular tachycardia .
status post ICD placement , status post pacemaker placement for symptomatic sinus bradycardia , history of seizure disorder , history of asthma , status post right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis , history of inferior vena cava filter placement .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Replacement of ICD pulse generator .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a 55-year-old female , with complicated prior medical history , including myotonic muscular dystrophy , resulting in cardiomyopathy , who also had multiple , recurrent ventricular tachycardias in the past requiring cardioversion , radio frequency ablation , pulse generator placement ( cardiovascular defibrillator ) 08/93 .
The patient is now admitted for elective replacement of her pulse generator due to end of life .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient underwent successful replacement of her pulse generator .
This procedure was quite complicated , required intubation during [ ] anesthesia due to respiratory compromise , and was technically challenging ; however , preexistent leads did not show any problems , and the patient received new Medtronic [ ] pulse generator .
The DFT was less than 24 joules .
The patient was extubated successfully and recovered uneventfully .
Final settings of her device include ejection fraction detection at the rate of 182 beats per minutes , therapy for this is 34 joules x 6 , VT detection between 160-182 beats per minute , therapy for this is 10 joules x 1 and 34 joules x 4 .
VVI is set in the backup mode at the rate of 40 beats per minute .
The patient &apos;s pacemaker was also interrogated after procedure , if settings did not change during defibrillation , and includes minimum rate of 60 beats per minute with a maximum rate of 90 beats per minute , the mode is VVIR , bipolar configuration with a lead of an amplitude of 5 volts and with .5 msec .
The patient &apos;s length of longevity was estimated at 35 months at this time .
The patient recovered uneventfully after the procedure .
She received standard antibiotics .
She is back to her baseline ambulatory level .
She is going to be discharged home today with follow up with Dr. Jescdrig in his private office in about two months .
She will also be followed in ICD Clinic .

ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
5-3-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
5-12-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .
There was an audible air leak .
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Elective transcatheter radio frequency ablation of the AV node for drug refractory atrial fibrillation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83 year old male with longstanding atrial fibrillation that has proved refractory to numerous AV nodal agents in the past .
He was recently hospitalized at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital in the summer of 1993 for elective radio frequency ablation of the AV node , however , the patient , after extensive discussions , declined this procedure .
He is now readmitted after reconsideration and willingness to undergo treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is significant for 1. chronic atrial fibrillation , refractory to numerous medications , as above ,
2. peripheral vascular disease , status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in April 1989 , status post axio-bifemoral grafts in September 1992 .
3. Status post permanent pacemaker implantation in 1984 ( Medtronic model # 8422 VVI ) ,
4. no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , the patient appeared well .
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response between 100 and 130 beats per minute .
The lungs were clear .
The Cardiovascular exam showed an irregular rhythm .
The first and second heart sounds were otherwise normal .
There were no murmurs or gallops .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing , and a left bundle branch block pattern at baseline .
The baseline creatinine was 1.8 .
The hematocrit was 44 and the prothrombin time was 12.7 on the evening of admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory on 4-24-93 .
The baseline rhythm was documented to be atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response rate of 125 beats per minute .
A total of two radio frequency applications ( 60 seconds , 55 volts , 33 watts ) was applied with the ablation catheter and a typical HIS position ( right anteroseptal ) resulting in complete heart block with an underlying ventricular rhythm resulting from pacing at 50 beats per minute .
No spontaneous rhythm was demonstrated after pacemaker programming down to a rate of 30 beats per minute .
After fifteen minutes of observation , the rhythm remained ventricular paced at 50 beats per minute with a threshold of 2.5 volts at 0.1 milliseconds pulse width .
The pacemaker was reprogrammed to a rate of 70 beats per minute at 2.5 volts and 0.5 milliseconds pulse width .
Sensitivity was reprogrammed to 5 volts .
The patient tolerated this procedure without difficulty .
He was transferred back to the Scst.ontdrain University Medical Center Step Down Unit in satisfactory condition .
There were no groin complications related to his venous puncture site .
He was maintained on interim heparin and his Coumadin was reinitiated .
Throughout the remainder of his hospitalization he remained in atrial fibrillation with complete heart block , as expected , with ventricular demand pacing at 70 beats per minute .
The final program settings of his Medtronic # 8422 VVI pacemaker were 70 beats per minute , pulse width 0.5 milliseconds , amplitude 2.5 volts , sensitivity 5 millivolts , refractory period 325 milliseconds .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Drug resistance atrial fibrillation ,
2. radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle ,
3. pacemaker dependence ,
4. peripheral vascular disease , as above .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. Radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle with resultant complete AV block and pacemaker dependence , 4-24-93 ,
2. transthoracic echocardiogram , 4-25-93 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin 5 mg qhs five days a week omitting Sunday and Wednesday .
COMPLICATIONS :
None .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will follow up with his local cardiologist at Da Valley Health , Dr. Ri Roleubbreun .
He will be seen by Dr. Shuff in the future as necessary .

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF LUNG PRIMARY .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
4/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
4/20/94
DATE OF BIRTH :
9/9/1930 .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung primary .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic brain tumor .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Days presented in September 1993 with a dry cough , and left arm / hand paresthesias .
Workup at that time showed a large right upper lobe lung mass , infiltrating positive C4-C6 vertebrae , and appeared to be threatening the spinal cord .
Mr. Days underwent a biopsy and stabilization procedure of the C4 through C6 veretebrae by Drs. Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .
The biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .
Mr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .
Bone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .
In December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .
Since that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .
Compression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .
Mr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .
He also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .
He also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .
On 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .
They recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .
He was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .
He received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .
On the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .
The patient &apos;s family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .
He denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His adenocarcinoma is outlined above .
2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .
3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
MS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .
His initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .
His hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .
His differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .
His electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .
His glucose was 166 .
His calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .
His chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :
There was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .
There was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .
The right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .
There may be two additional smaller metastases present .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .
His temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .
His oropharynx was benign .
His neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .
His lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .
On cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .
His abdomen :
He did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities :
He had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
His skin :
He did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .
Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .
Strength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .
His sensory examination was grossly intact .
There were no cerebellar deficits .
His reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .
The patient &apos;s HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :
1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .
2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .
3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .
This may or may not be pathologic .
The patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .
The patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .
The patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .
At the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .
Also of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .
The patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .
This hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient &apos;s quality of life .

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
stable .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Pauci May is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .
He developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .
He denied any angina .
He had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .
His pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .
An echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .
He was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .
A Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .
His coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .
On June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .
He was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .
His ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .
He did smoke up to three pack per day .
He has three children .
He is retired .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Six foot , 250 pounds .
He is a well appearing male , in no distress .
HIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .
His neck veins were not distended .
His carotids showed bilateral bruits .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His abdomen is obese , but benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
He has no peripheral edema .
His Neurological exam is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .
Uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .
hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .
urinalysis was unremarkable .
His chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .
His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .
There were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .
There , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .
There was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .
On June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .
He placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .
He weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .
He had no hemodynamic difficulties .
He was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .
He did revert back to atrial fibrillation .
He was extubated within forty eight hours .
He was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .
He reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .
He could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .
He also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .
He was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .
Weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .
He was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .
He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .
It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .
Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .
He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .

2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down &apos;s syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .
Mr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .
A recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .
A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .
This study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .
Subsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .
The patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .
On Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .
At operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .
The surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .
Since that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .
It should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .
The patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Down &apos;s syndrome ,
2 ) intestinal malrotation ,
3 ) status post Ladd &apos;s procedure ,
4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,
2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Remarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down &apos;s facies , in no acute distress .
Vital signs :
temperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .
His pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .
Examination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .
Examination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .
Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb &apos;s point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
There are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .
There is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .
Rectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
A panel of serum electrolytes is normal .
The white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .
Lymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .
Alkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .
Total bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .
Total protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .
Serum amylase is 43 .
Calcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .
X-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .
KUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .
Ultrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .
Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .
Electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .
The axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .
A modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .
Therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .
This study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .
A temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .
The patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .
He was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .
Because of the probable malignant nature of the patient &apos;s biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .
This procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .
Additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .
These procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .
As before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .
He was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .
Preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .
However , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .
Following the permanent stent placement , the patient &apos;s diet was slowly advanced .
His serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .
Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Improved .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
1 ) Discharged to group home ,
2 ) diet as tolerated ,
3 ) activity ad lib ,
4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,
5 )
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .

SEVERE BLUNT ABDOMINAL TRAUMA .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
7-2-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
7-30-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Grade II / V laceration of liver ,
2. rupture of left renal vein ,
3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,
4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,
5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .
The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .
He was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .
He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .
Intravenous fluids was given .
He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .
He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .
Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .
He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .
His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .
The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .
His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .
At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .
There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .
Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided &quot; Mattox &quot; maneuvers were performed .
The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .
This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .
The vein was divided and suture ligated .
Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .
The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .
The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .
The patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer &apos;s lactate .
An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .
Intracranial pressures were normal .
That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .
An arch aortogram was normal .
Over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .
The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .
He was returned to the operating room on July 4 .
Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .
Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .
Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .
Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .
The patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .
However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .
He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &apos;s course .
Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .
He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .
Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .
Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .
The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .
It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .
The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .
He was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .
Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .
There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .
The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .
On July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .
On July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .
His blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
Martin Luther King Day
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/22/93
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Louplardkote is a 70 year old male who was admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .
He has been followed by his local physician for heart block which has progressed and culminated in a DDD pacer being inserted 02/92 .
In March , 1993 he noted chest discomfort with exertion .
An exercise tolerance test and stress Thallium showed septal and anterior wall ischemia .
In October , 1993 the patient developed shortness of breath and orthopnea .
An echocardiogram at the time revealed left ventricular dilatation and septal dyskinesis .
The patient subsequently developed congestive heart failure which was treated with diuretics .
On 12/29 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a right coronary artery that had serial stenosis , and left anterior descending artery that had a long complex proximal lesion and a circumflex which had its first obtuse marginal which was stenotic .
The left ventriculogram showed global hypokinesis and preserved left ventricular function with mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation .
The patient is thus admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) hypercholesterolemia ,
2 ) arthritis ,
3 ) history of guaiac-positive stools with a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy negative three years ago ,
4 ) status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Toprol XL 50 mg. po q.day , Ismo 20 mg. po bid , Lasix 40 mg. d , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop po bid , nitroglycerin spray prn .
ALLERGIES :
no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam was benign .
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a I-II / VI late systolic murmur radiating to the apex .
Lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Rectal :
guaiac negative , no lesions , smooth prostate .
Vascular exam ; 2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , chest x-ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs .
These were also seen on previous film .
These were felt to be consistent with a granulomata .
There was also a bipolar pacemaker present .
Creatinine was 0.9 , BUN 13 , hematocrit was 40 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .
This operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .
Intraoperative findings were as follows :
The pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal .
The diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .
The circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .
The first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .
The left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .
The acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .
The patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .
The only issue of note during the patient &apos;s SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .
The other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for an atrial sensing problem .
The pace setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated .
It was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re-programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts .
No changes with unipolar ring or tip .
The V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .
The V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .
It was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .
Meanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .
While on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .
Of note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .
Also , the Pacer Service re-programmed the patient &apos;s cardiac pacer to a VVIR mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , an AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 .
The ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V-pulse width of .8 , a V-pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V-sense configuration of bipolar , a V-sensitivity of 2.0 and a V-refractory of 250 .
The atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with an A-pulse width of .4 , an A-pulse amplitude of 2.5 , an A-sensed configuration that was bipolar , an A-sensitivity that was .5 , an A-refractory that was 325 .
Blanking was set at 38 , AV-safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV-delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off .
The threshhold was 2.0 .
The measured average sensor was 2.0 .
The slope was 8 .
The maximum sensory rate was 110 .
The reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium .
The patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on 01/22/93 in good condition .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery on 01/17/93 by Dr. Chitllik Kote .

01/06/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/17/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left lung atelectasis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .

1/13/94 - flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
2/14/94 - tracheostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .
Her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .
Her x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .
She underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .
She was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) hysterectomy .
( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .
( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :
sclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .
Chest :
decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .
Extremities :
slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .
Electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :
tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .
Her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .
Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .
There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .
She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .
These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .
Intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .
It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .
This proceeded uneventfully .
She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .
However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .
This appeared to be respiratory in origin .
She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .
Pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .
Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .
She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .
Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction .
She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .
This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .
She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .
She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .
Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .
However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .
This improved her cardiac function .
She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .
She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .
The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .
She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .
She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .
Given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .
This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .
Her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.
The patient &apos;s family was notified .

ADMISSION DATE :
5/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
5/16/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hypopharyngeal cancer .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Removal of left neck lymph node and esophageal endoscopy and dilation .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a 69 year-old white male status post surgery in July of 1993 for a laryngopharyngoesophagogastrectomy with gastric reconstruction and modified right neck dissection for pharyngeal cancer .
Since that surgery , the patient has had dysphagia off and on , solids worse than liquids .
Sometimes solids get stuck for about 10 minutes .
About two months ago the patient had come to the emergency room because he couldn &apos;t swallow for three days .
He required esophageal dilation .
Also , since July the patient has noted bilateral lymphadenopathy , especially the large submandibular , which has gotten larger .
It is difficult to get an exact history as to the onset of the lymphadenopathy , as the patient cannot vocalize and is intoxicated at the time of admission .
The lymphadenopathy is uncomfortable but not painful .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for radiation therapy after his surgery in July , a tracheoesophageal fistula , which was repaired , exploratory laparotomy in November , 1994 , for small bowel obstruction , hypertension , colitis , neonatal jaundice , and on September 1 , 1993 , drainage of a neck abscess .
He underwent closure of pharyngeal cutaneous fistula with muscle interposition on November 5 , 1994 , and a left upper lobectomy in September , 1993 , for lung cancer .
ALLERGIES :
Aspirin .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for heavy alcohol use and history of heavy tobacco use , although he quit two years ago .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No fevers or chills , no nightsweats .
Positive weight gain since his last admission , positive diarrhea times two weeks-soft brown stools .
Negative bright red blood per rectum , negative coughing , negative hemoptysis , negative hematemesis , negative chest pain , positive shortness of breath with exertion .
The patient can walk or go up a flight of stairs without any shortness of breath , however .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a pleasant , mildly intoxicated male with grossly swollen neck .
He was afebrile with stable vital signs .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , regular and reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular muscles intact .
Tongue with multiple white-yellow lesions .
Neck grossly swollen at the midline and right angle with jaw , unable to fully swallow .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This 69 year-old male status post laryngopharyngo-esophagogastrectomy for cancer in 05/93 now represents with progressive dysphagia and gross lymphadenopathy and neck mass .
The patient is mildly intoxicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was given overnight hydration .
He was taken to the operating room on May 14 , 1994 , for a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy , dilatation and biopsy .
His left neck mass was excised and preliminarily was said to be squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient had esophagoscopy , where a stenosis was noted which was dilated to a # 49 French catheter .
There were no complications .
The patient was taken to the floor in stable condition .
Postoperatively , there was no crepitus and X-rays showed no mediastinal air .
Neck biopsy site was clean .
On May 15 , the patient &apos;s diet was advanced to a soft diet and then later in the day to a regular diet .
Radiation Oncology was consulted and it was determined that Mr. Douet still had room for more palliative radiation therapy of his neck , and he arranged an appointment with Dr. Wires on Tuesday following discharge .
Dr. Wires &apos;s telephone number is 526-6508 .
On May 16 , the patient was tolerating PO well , his lungs were clear , and he was discharged to home in stable condition .

4 ) Crohn &apos;s disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
6/13/94 :
Intra-aortic balloon placement .
6/17/94 :
Intubation .
Hemodialysis .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .
Mr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .
He had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .
His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .
In August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .
He rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .
He was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .
An automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .
He was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .
Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .
Mr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .
He was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .
Colonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn &apos;s disease with sparing of the rectum .
A perirectal fistula was seen .
Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .
On the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .
He presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .
He was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .
Hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .
His CVP was 16 .
He was on the balloon pump at the time .
His chest was clear anteriorly .
His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .
No murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .
His abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .
His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .
The sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .
Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .
There were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .
The chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .
He was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .
It was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .
After replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .
He did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .
It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .
He also remained intubated .
Mr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn &apos;s disease .
All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .
As Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .
He was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .
Dr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .
Procainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .
Initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .
As Mr. Given &apos;s renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .
This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .
He was able to get some fluid off as well .
With getting some volume off , the patient &apos;s ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .
His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .
On 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .
With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .
The balloon pump was restored .
He was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .
He continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .
Supportive care continued .
Unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .
Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .
Mr. Given &apos;s blood pressure appeared to stabilize .
Another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .
He had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .
Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .
He did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .
His hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .
He continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .
Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .
This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .
He did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .
On 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .
The patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .
He began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .
The patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .
Indicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .
He developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Le is a seventy three year old male who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , following a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Mr. Le was found in bed with a 32 caliber revolver at his side .
The patient was apparently alone at home , his neighbors heard a single shot , and the paramedics were called .
Upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin .
The patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable .
He therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house .
Apparently , the gun belonged to his father .
On further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home .
The patient expressed concern that he had several utility bills that he was unable to pay .
The patient &apos;s sister died eight years prior to the patient &apos;s admission of leukemia , and he otherwise has no next of kin with the exception of one brother in Washington , with whom his relationship is tenuous .
On initial questioning , however , the patient denies any recent losses .
On admission , the patient denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation .

He has a sixty to seventy five pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol approximately one time per week .
He denies any ilicit drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is an obese male in no acute distress .
The vital signs temperature 98.0 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 186/69 , respirations 18 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination revealed an entry wound approximately 1 1/2 inches above the right ear , which is approximately 1 cm. in length and surrounded by powder burn .
There is a lump in the right parietal region , which corresponds with the bullet seen on the computerized tomography scan .
There is no bruising about the eyes or mastoid sinuses , and there is no fluid from the nose or ears .
The neck was supple , and without adenopathy .
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm and no murmur , rub or gallop are appreciated .
The abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , without hepatosplenomegaly .
There are no masses and the bowel sounds are present .
The extremities are well perfused and there is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological :
examination revealed a patient who was alert and oriented X 3 , with short term recall of 2/3 objects at five minutes and fluent speech .
The patient remembers the presidents as Carter-Bush-Regan-Truman-Roosevelt .
The patient was able to spell world backwards on the third attempt .
He performed serial 7 &apos;s accurately .
He demonstrated poor ability for abstract thinking .
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the extra ocular movements are intact .
The fundi are benign and the discs are sharp .
The patient &apos;s strength is 5/5 throughout and the sensorium is intact .
The deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
A panel of serum electrolytes is normal .
The white blood count is 9.4 , hematocrit 47.1 , and the platelets 253,000 .
Blood coagulation times are normal .
Serum toxic screen is negative .
Leukocyte differential count reveals 64 neutrophils , 24% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , 2% eosinophils , and 2% basophils .
A panel of serum enzymes suggest normal hepatic function .
A computerized tomography scan of the head reveals a small external skull fracture , approximately 1-2 millemeters in size , near the right frontoparietal apex .
A right parietal contusion is also identified , with blood tracking into the middle focus .
Standard 12 lead electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 85 , with poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V3 suggesting the possibility of an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
Nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities are present as well .
Otherwise , the axis is normal and the intervals are normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
BREUNCA , AREU T
UNIT NUMBER :
961-88-20
ADMISSION DATE :
12/20/2002
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/26/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia ( AVNRT ) .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1. AV conduction tissue disease .
2. Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .
He was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .
He was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .
He also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .
At the time of his visit to his cardiologist &apos;s office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .
In the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Ecotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .
JVP was not raised .
His cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .
His abdominal examination was benign .
Lungs were clear .
His EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .
His EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .
IMPRESSION :
Patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .
He was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .
It was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .
His baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.
He had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .
Two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .
The patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .
The procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .
On the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .
This was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .
His atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .
The atrial measurements were as follows :
amplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .
His ventricular measurements were as follows :
RV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .
The patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .
Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .
A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .
Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .
After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .
The patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .
He has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .
He is being discharged on :
1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Detrol 5 mg p.o. t.i.d.

SUMMARY :
In summary , this an 81 year old gentleman with a significant cardiac history and alcohol history who presented to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with loss of consciousness , who had a tox screen and a negative head computer tomogram who likely is suffering from an alcohol related fall versus syncope .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to Lyjoneshutchepawalt Cleod Exre Hospital for observation .
It was felt that he should be ruled out for an myocardial infarction given his cardiac history and was placed in two point restraints .
When the patient came to the floor he was angry and upset about admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital instead of the Bridges Hospital and was somewhat combative .
He admitted to drinking 1 pint or so of alcohol not every day but the last drink was the night prior to admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and he had a couple of glasses of wine .
He was quite confused in relaying the history and very tangential in his replies .
He says he was out to lunch some friends to eat pizza at a restaurant on Valemin .
He decided to go to the basemen so they could eat in privacy when he was hit over the head by police with a gun and lost consciousness at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward .
He was quite paranoid , agitated and delusional during an interview and there is no evidence to support the patient &apos;s history and recall of events leading to the hospitalization .
Hospital course by system .
1. NEUROLOGICALLY :
The patient is completely alert , awake and oriented x 3 .
The patient shows no evidence of alcohol withdrawal although he was prophylactically treated with Ativan and was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate .
Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that he was suffering from alcohol related syndrome versus some component of pugilist brain given the fact that he was a boxer in the past .
They felt that there was no acute psychiatric issue at hand .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :

Outside chest x-ray dated July 2 , 1998 demonstrates multiple tiny dense nodules in the lateral and superior left lung with scattered nodules in the right upper lung .
These nodules are confirmed by chest CT and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices .
The CT also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Because of the extensiveness of Ms. Abreun &apos;s hospital course it will be organized by system :
1. Neurological :
On admission the patient was intubated and sedated .
Her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .
A psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .
On August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .
She spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .
2. Pulmonary :
Ms. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .
After two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .
Over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .
By August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .
At this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .
She was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .
After her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .
At the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .
3. Cardiovascular :
Ms. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .
She was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .
She required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .
At this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .
A Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .
She was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .
After the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .
4. Renal :
Ms. Abreun &apos;s fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .
She presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .
Renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .
At this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .
An elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient &apos;s course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .
Her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .
At the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .
5. Gastrointestinal :
Ms. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .
She was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .
On July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .
These G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .
She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .
At the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .
This problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
She is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .
She has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .
Ms. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .
These values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .
Stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .
5 &apos;nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .
To date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 &apos;nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .
Further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .
6. Infectious disease :
Ms. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .
She ruled out by PPD .
The initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .
Because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .
The course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .
At this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .
She then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .
ON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .
Shortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .
After a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .
On discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .
Ms. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .
Because of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .
Her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .
Her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .
Ms. Abreun &apos;s hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .
At the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .
More active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .
She has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .
However , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .
Her discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .
IN SUMMARY :
Ms. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .
Over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .
Her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .
Her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .
Currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .
Her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .

On the six hour flight , the patient suddenly felt worsening of her shortness of breath and got up and vomited .
She was also incontinent .
An anesthesiologist on board saw her and felt that she was significantly hypotensive and had the plane land emergently at Nebraska .
She was subsequently transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
In the emergency room the patient was given nebulizers .
She was placed on I.V. Heparin and given oxygen three liters with sats remaining somewhere between 85 and 90% .
She was also started on Zithromax .

Chest X-ray :
subtle increased density in the left middle lung .
Electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor R progression V1 through V3 , and P. pulmonale with right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK &apos;s which were normal .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .
The RVSP was estimated at 35 .
Echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .
The patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .
The patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .
The patient &apos;s heparin was subsequently discontinued .
Pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient &apos;s room air sat hovering around 90% .
Microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .
The patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .
It was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus / minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-CK &apos;s and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .
It was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .
The patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .
Repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .
Pulmonary Service was consulted .
They recommendations included smoking cessation , recommendation for O2 use if flying back home to Missouri , continuing antibiotics for a 14 days course , albuterol , Atrovent MDI &apos;s and follow-up of pleural effusions with one month repeat chest x-ray .
It was subsequently arranged for the patient to transfer back to Balau for care there with a pulmonologist as well as her primary-care physician .
The patient was discharged in good state of health , ambulating .
Sats with and without O2 were above 88% .
A complete copy of the medical chart was sent with the patient to Lo .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Cefuroxime 500 mg. PO b.i.d. times 10 days , albuterol inhalers 2 puffs q4 hours , Atrovent inhalers 2 puffs q6 hours , Prednisone 40 mg. PO qday , then taper as directed by primary-care physician in Reveverburg .

The patient was originally diagnosed in 06/98 during a routine physical when he was noted to have a white blood cell count of 20,000 , weight loss , and swelling in his neck and groin .
He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Dehydration , electrolyte imbalance , weakness and fainting .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Dehydration , electrolyte imbalance .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has had longstanding diarrhea over the years and comes in because of severe dehydration , referred from the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital .
He had had previous studies including a computed axial tomography scan which showed no pathology and they were at a loss to explain his diarrhea and dehydration .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Accordingly , the patient underwent numerous studies here , all of which were negative including endoscopic assessment of his upper gastrointestinal tract and colonoscopy , both of which were normal .
The patient seemed to settle down while in the hospital and in fact started to have solid bowel movements and so on a controlled diet , which was purposely free of milk and milk products , the patient was discharged to be followed by his doctor , Dr. Both at the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital but suffice it to say that no pathology was found in this hospital .
He had widespread abdominal distention and for a while looked like he might have had ischemic problems with his sigmoid colon resulting in a functional large bowel obstruction but this cleared while he was in the hospital and he expelled large amounts of gas and decompressed his distention and his diarrhea stopped and he seemed to be much , much better .
Whether this was related to medication , viral gastroenteritis or ischemic bowel problems is unclear , but he got better and went home .

In brief , her history dates back to 1978 when she was diagnosed with coronary artery disease , status post catheterization .
She was treated medically until 1981 at which point she had a CABG X2 .
In 1985 she had a routine CABG with two saphenous vein grafts , and a LIMA to the LAD complicated to ARDS and prolonged intubation .
She then went for 13 years without significant symptoms .
In the fall of 1998 she sustained an MI and an echo at that point revealed an EF of 40% .
In October , 1998 , she had another redo CABG with the radial artery to the LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM .
This was complicated by a DVT .
In 04/98 , she began to have chest pain consistently upon walking .
In 06/98 , she developed rest angina , which was relieved with nitroglycerin .
In 10/98 , she had a positive stress test and was put on 5 milligrams of Norvasc which was subsequently increased to 10 milligrams .
Since New Years Eve , after a family argument she had two hours of chest pain , and was sent to the Spanton Memorial Hospital Emergency Department .
She received enoxaparin but this was complicated by severe ecchymoses over her flank , and therefore the enoxaparin was discontinued .
On 01/06 , she had a thallium stress test which revealed diffuse subendocardial ischemia with ST depressions in 1 , L , V2 and V3 .
She was transferred to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital for a catheterization which revealed an 80% ostial left main , 50% distal left main , 90% mid-left circumflex , 80% proximal OM , and occluded proximal right coronary artery which was fed by distal collaterals .

Report Status :
Unsigned
Discharge Date :
12/04/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1. Recent upper GI bleed thought to be gastritis .
2. Post operative bleeding requiring a return visit to the Operating Room for control of bleeding .
In addition , it was thought that the patient probably exhibited tamponade physiology and a chest tube was left in place following that for several days .
3. The patient exhibited an episode of severe leukopenia thought secondary to Diuril .
The patient will be instructed no longer to ever take Diuril or any Thiazide diuretics .
4. The patient does have a history of diabetes .
5. The patient does have a history of carotid endarterectomies .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Sterpspardkotebaune is a 75 year old gentleman transferred from Shore Medical Center with three vessel coronary disease after having been admitted there on 11/17/98 for CHF and unstable angina .
The patient required intubation and aggressive diuresis .
The patient reports that he does feel much better .
He did rule in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and was treated with TPA .
He was transferred for CABG .
He had a recent carotid ultrasound which revealed no significant disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for coronary artery disease , CHF , recent upper GI bleed thought to be gastritis , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , glaucoma .
He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
Digoxin 0.125 once a day , enteric coated aspirin once a day , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Nitroglycerin paste q. six hours , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale and intravenous Heparin .
ALLERGIES :
On admission he reported no known allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed that his heart was regular rate and rhythm and he had distant heart sounds .
His lungs exhibited crackles throughout .
His abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds and benign .
His rectal exam did reveal guaiac positive stools most likely secondary to his recent upper GI bleed .
His extremities were unremarkable .
Neurologic exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a BUN and creatinine of 39 and 2.0 .
White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit of 30 and platelet count of 215 .
EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm at 94 .
His catheterization done at the outside hospital revealed a 50% left main lesion , a 50% and 90% LAD lesion , a 90% circumflex lesion , 100% right coronary lesion and an ejection fraction of 25% .
The operation included the following :
1. On 11/26/98 the patient was taken to the Operating Room and had a three vessel coronary bypass done and a right coronary artery endarterectomy .
In addition , he had a repair to the left subclavian vein .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient did require insertion of intra-aortic balloon pump , however , after surgery .
On post operative day # 1 the patient was noted to have significant amounts of chest tube drainage of approximately 2.5 liters and was thought to exhibit some tamponade physiology .
He did have a left hemothorax .
He was taken back to the Operating Room for drainage of this and a chest tube was left in place following that for several days .
2. The second operation was a reoperation for bleeding at which time he had a mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
The patient tolerated that procedure well and was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
The patient had the intra-aortic balloon weaned off on 11/28/98 .
On 11/29/98 it was noted the patient had an acute drop in his white blood cell count .
The lowest white blood cell count was 1.25 .
Hematology was consulted on this and they thought this was most likely secondary to administration of Diuril .
The patient was taken off the medication and his white blood cell count gradually began to rise .
On post operative day # 7 the patient had the one remaining chest tube removed .
COMPLICATIONS :
1. Post operative bleeding requiring return to the Operating Room for mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
2. Profound leukopenia thought secondary to Diuril administration .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

9 ) Isosorbide dinitrate unclear dose .
10 ) Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Epogen q. two weeks .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .
The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left sided spastic hemiparesis , status post surgical correction of C-1 , C-2 dural AVM .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .

RUPTURED AORTIC ANEURISM
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
09/16/2000
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .

PULMONARY EMBOLUS
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
04/06/1998
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
04/12/1998
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
PULMONARY EMBOLUS HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient remained in-house on IV heparin awaiting discharge to rehabilitation at Ocfasciences Valley Hospital Medical Center at the Wesrajoke Healthcare .
The patient &apos;s course remained uncomplicated .
Hematology :
The patient &apos;s hematocrit has slowly drifted down from his admission hematocrit of 38 down to 33.6 .
Given that the patient had not had a bowel movement during his entire hospital course , we were unable to document whether he was having gastrointestinal loss but it is unlikely that it is a large bleed , given there is no overt evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient will ultimately need a colonoscopy as an outpatient , given his age and concern for occult malignancy as a cause of his likely gastrointestinal blood loss .
That can be arranged by his primary care physician back in Plain Pa .
Pulmonary embolus :
The patient will need to remain on Coumadin for six months .
His Coumadin dose will need to be titrated while at Coness- Tansdener Medical Center .
For the time being , his Tamoxifen is being held given its thrombogenic potential and that will have to be readdressed by his primary care physician upon his return to Rie , North Dakota .
It may not be unreasonable to restart the tamoxifen even whileon the coumadin .
Orthopedics :
The patient is status post multiple left upper extremity fractures .
The patient was followed by orthopedics during his hospital stay .
He will not need to follow-up at Pointexasp Region General Hospital during his stay at the rehabilitation and can follow-up once he returns back to Grovecu And in three to four weeks .
His fractures are stable by x-ray .
Physical therapy :
The patient has been cleared for passive range of motion exercises at the left elbow approximately two to three weeks after his initial fractures which will be on Monday , 04/15/98 .
The patient will need to have aggressive physical therapy for reconditioning given his marked deconditioning from his past two hospitalizations .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 1,250 units per hour IV until INR greater than 2 , Lactulose 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , vitamin E 400 units p.o. q.d. , Trazedone 50 mg p.o. qhs , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. qhs , multivitamin with iron 1 tablet p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets q4h p.r.n. pain .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
The patient is discharged to Coness- Tansdener Medical Center where he will need aggressive physical therapy given his deconditioning status post his fall and recent hospitalization .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will need follow-up with his primary care physician back in Ma Tony , Rhode Island in three weeks , as well as orthopedic follow-up in Wawa Lero .

BREAST CARCINOMA
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
04/26/1999
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
05/14/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) Breast cancer as per history of present illness .
( 2 ) Hypertension .

She had a large R-wave in V2 , in V1 but with R less than S. She had an inverted T-wave in lead 3 , otherwise , no Q , ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a 48-year-old woman with high risk carcinoma of the breast admitted for a STAMP with cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin .
The patient was started on the standard protocol with day 0 being equal to December 1999 .
Her hospital course was , overall , uncomplicated and notable for the following events :
( 1 ) Hematology / Oncology :
The patient became neutropenic on day minus 2 and reached a nadir of white blood count of 0.02 on May 8 .
She had her first neutropenic fever on May 9 , 1999 , and all cultures from blood and urine are negative .
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia .
The patient was started on ceftazidime initially for febrile neutropenia , but quickly developed a pleuritic rash .
She was put on piperacillin and gentamicin for enteric antibiotic coverage .
She recovered her count and was no longer neutropenic on May 11 , 1999 , which is day plus 8 .
On day plus 9 , she had a white count of over 10,000 and her antibiotic coverage was discontinued , as was the G-CSF .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 106y year old female with coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , Alzheimer &apos;s disease and a history of bradycardia .
She is a resident of Barnes-vantsver Community Hospital , where she was smoking in the smoking room , when her clothing caught on fire , necessitating admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
She sustained 15% total body surface area burns to her upper chest , bilateral arms and scalp .
These represented 5% third degree burns and 10% second degree burns .
She was resuscitated and transferred to the Burn Unit on Kentnaalvet Medical Center .
She was treated conservatively , and over the course of the next few days , appeared to ruled in for a small myocardial infarction by CPK &apos;s and electrocardiograms .
She was treated conservatively for this and was not taken to the operating room initially , because of the concerns over potential inability to extubate her postoperatively , as well as chances that she could not survive the operation .
Extensive conversations were held with the family and in fact a family meeting was held , where it was decided that the patient would be a do not resuscitate status , indicating no cardiopulmonary resuscitation , no electrocardioversion and no intubation .
It was agreed upon , however , that the patient would continue to receive medical care , which would include operative treatment , when indicated .
However , on the morning of 05/29/94 , the patient developed hypoxemia , respiratory distress , bradycardia and hypotension , which was treated successfully with bagging and tracheal suctioning .
Subsequently , she developed anuric renal failure , hypocapnia and acidosis , resulting in myocardial infarction and a systolic arrest .
Her time of death was 1:50 p.m.
Her family was notified that she was dying and were present at the time of death .
The medical examiner was notified , and admitting was notified immediately .

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
POOR
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Fever , abdominal pain and vomiting .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Riie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and &quot; left kidney pain &quot; .
This patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .
In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .
In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .
In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .
In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .
CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .
In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .
Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .
Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .
That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .
He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .
It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .
Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .
Mr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .
As well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to &quot; kidney pain &quot; .
He was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .
Mr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .
He denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea .
There is no joint swelling or tenderness .

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
09/14/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sternal wound infection .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Infected aortic graft .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient &apos;s hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient &apos;s early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient &apos;s sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient &apos;s wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient &apos;s only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .

Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .
The patient &apos;s preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient &apos;s sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient &apos;s precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient &apos;s intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient &apos;s family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient &apos;s sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient &apos;s sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient &apos;s subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient &apos;s Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient &apos;s intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient &apos;s indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient &apos;s condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Diet :
High calorie , high protein .
The patient &apos;s treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .
The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .

7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .
8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .
9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .
The patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
The patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
The patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient &apos;s discharge .
Dr. Dau &apos;s recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .
2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .
3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) Hypertension .
3 ) Status post hysterectomy .
4 ) Status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :

2 ) Lasix p.r.n.
3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .
4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5 ) Thiamine .
6 ) Lasix p.r.n.
7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
8 ) Folic acid .
9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .
10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Insulin sliding scale .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
She has two children .
She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1999 at 12:30 PM .

LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
During hospitalization computerized tomography scan examination of brain performed with and without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained , following demonstration of left partial homonymous hemianopsia .
Computerized tomography scan demonstrated two murally enhancing cystic masses , the first occupying much of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere , the second shown focally in the left lateral occipital lobe , with associated vasogenic edema .
Metastatic disease suspected .
Additional magnetic resonance angiogram examination requested .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on 1/10/99 , at which time intentional balloon sacrifice of right coronary artery was performed .
Systemic anticoagulation was accomplished with limited mobility permitted .
Over the course of the next three days the patient was mobilized .
At this time the diagnosis of presumed metastatic involvement of a super-tentorial and infratentorial compartments had been arrived at , and it was also noted that the patient &apos;s swallowing was sufficiently impaired where Nutrition was compromised and in question .
It was decided at this point that the patient &apos;s neck resection may need to be withheld pending exploration of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy options , and that the Nutrition status would need to be addressed .
As such , it was decided that a transfer to the Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital under Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot &apos;care , who is the patient &apos;s Oncologic Otolaryngologic Surgeon , should be entertained .
On the evening of 1/14/99 , nursing noticed that the patient was somewhat confused , and suspected a possible post ictal state .
As such , the patient was placed on Dilantin , and Dilantin is being continued .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Service is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of anal squamous cell carcinoma , who is admitted with a history of fevers .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 03/98 with a 6 cm rectal mass .
Biopsy , at that time , showed squamous cell carcinoma .
A staging CT , at that time , showed no evidence of inguinal lymph node .
The patient was treated with 5-FU , mitomycin , as well as XRT with complete remission .
However , in 09/98 , the patient was noted to have recurrent anal mass with inguinal lymphadenopathy .
An inguinal biopsy , at that time , showed a squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient was treated with cisplatin and taxol x4 cycles , which was completed in 3/4/99 .
The patient was noted to have partial response to this .
On 3/26/99 , the patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection and a reconstruction rectus flap .
His hospital course was complicated by postoperative fevers , which were treated with Keflex .
However , since that time , the patient has had persistent multiple perineal non-wound healing with drainage .
The patient initially presented on 6/4/99 , with a three week history of fevers off of antibiotics .

LUNGS :
Decreased breath sounds on the right , clear on the left with crackles at the apices .
ABDOMEN :
Non-tender , positive bowel sounds , with several well healed scars .
A colostomy bag was intact .
Perineal exam was significant for surgical wounds x3 , with granulation tissue .
No obvious purulent material or abscesses were noted .
NEURO :
The patient was alert and oriented x3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Surgery Service with a history of fevers .
During his hospital course on the surgery service , he remained febrile .
He was initially treated with Ancef .
An Infectious Disease consult was obtained and antibiotics were discontinued .
The patient remained febrile off of antibiotics and was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count .
A chest x-ray obtained on 6/14/99 revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate and cefotaxime and Flagyl were started for a probable post-obstructive pneumonia .
On 6/15/99 , a repeat chest CT was obtained , which showed a very large right hilar mass with multiple pulmonary nodules .
CT , Surgery , and Pulmonary consults were obtained regarding further diagnostic evaluations .
In addition , the patient was also noted to be hypercalcemic and was treated with IV fluids and pamidronate .
The patient was subsequently transferred from the Surgery Service to the Oncology-D Service for further management on 6/16/99 .
Briefly , his hospital course by systems on the Oncology-D Service :
( 1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE - The patient was continued on cefotaxime and Flagyl for a probable post-obstructive pneumonia .
Per consult with the pulmonologist , it was not felt that the patient would likely benefit from any sort of procedure or stenting .
The decision was made to continue the patient on chronic antibiotic therapy .
The patient was discharged on IV ceftriaxone , as well as oral Flagyl with plan to continue IV ceftriaxone for one week and then switch to p.o. Augmentin .
In addition , the patient &apos;s surgical wounds were cultured to R / O any evidence of a wound infection .
Wound cultures from his buttock region revealed 1+ Acinetobacter , as well as 2+ diphtheroids with rare enterococci .
A perirectal culture showed normal fecal flora , and a second wound culture also revealed diphtheroids and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
These were thought to be contaminants , and the patient was not treated for wound infection .
( 2 ) PULMONARY - On 6/17/99 , the patient was noted to have markedly increased O2 requirements , with O2 sats noted in the low 80% on room air .
This increased to 90-93% on four liters nasal cannula .
The patient was noted to have increased wheezes on pulmonary exam .
A STAT portable chest x-ray revealed markedly increased opacification in the right hemithorax , with increased markings on the left , which was consistent with pulmonary edema .
An EKG was obtained , at that time , which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125 , with normal axis and no acute ST changes noted .
The patient was given IV Lasix with improvement in his O2 saturations .
It was also thought , at that time , given the patient &apos;s immobility that a pulmonary embolus was also a likely cause of the patient &apos;s hypoxia .
However , at that time , the decision had been made to make the patient DNR / DNI , and it was not felt that an aggressive workup for pulmonary embolus was indicated at that time .
Throughout the remainder of the patient &apos;s hospitalization , his respiratory status was stable .
( 3 ) METASTATIC ANAL CARCINOMA / CODE STATUS - Given the advanced nature of the patient &apos;s disease and his failure to respond to chemotherapeutic measures , upon discussion with the patient , the patient &apos;s wife , and the treatment team , the decision was made to pursue comfort measures , and the patient was made DNR / DNI .
It was felt that aggressive workup was not indicated at that time .
The goal of the patient &apos;s treatment was for maximum comfort and pain control .
( 4 ) HYPERCALCEMIA - The patient had been noted to be hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.3 .
He was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration , as well as pamidronate with normalization of his calcium level .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient was discharged on one week of IV ceftriaxone with p.o. Flagyl , with a plan to change IV ceftriaxone to p.o.

Multivitamin one tablet daily and Albuterol nebulizers qid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease .
She does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .
She has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .
She was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .
She denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
On the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .
Her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .
The electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .
Right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .
She was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 &apos;s developed .
The blood sugar was elevated at 208 .
The BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .
The uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .
When she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .
In the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .
The electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .
She had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .
Her only medication was Dyazide .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .
The pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .
The respirations 18 and she was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended .
The carotids were full .
There were no bruits .
The chest was clear with distant breath sounds .
The cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .
There were no rubs .
The abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .
There was no peripheral edema .
There were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .
There was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .
Her electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .
The cholesterol was 171 .
Triglycerides 103 .
By this time her CK was 600 .
Her hematocrit was 37.1 .
Hemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .
The PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .
Review of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .
She was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .
She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .
She became increasingly disoriented .
She developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .
The chest films showed mild cephalization .
She became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .
She went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .
She had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .
Catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .
The right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .
She had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .
She continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .
She remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .
Dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .
She was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .
She was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .
Eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .
She had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .
She was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .
The BUN rose to 91 .
Her Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .
She was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .
Efforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .
The right ventricular function was normal .
After extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .
The patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .
There was no structural abnormality .
Moistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .
She continued a rather slow improvement .
The patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .
The possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .
She had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
Renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .
She had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .
That can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .
Because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .
This was followed up and was shown to resolve .
MR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .
A MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .
She was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .

DISCHARGE DATE :
09/13/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic melanoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 .
Subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes .
He had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness .
He had this resected between 8/4 and 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 C of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity .
He has done well since that time and subsequently in 05/98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion .
He underwent an open splenectomy in the Fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen .
Since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with Allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule .
Most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at Brook Hospital by Dr. Bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer .
Since April through July this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease .
Surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested .
The patient has ___ Dr. Peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years .
The other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation .
In order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder .
This magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to Brook Hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma .
The patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at S Nakantlakeing University Hospital And Medical Center on 8/24/00 .
The positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced .
These were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan .
The patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound .
He is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a Texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis .
He also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity .
He has bilateral venous stasis and hypertension .

His right shoulder had a large 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2-3 weeks .
The bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before .
The axillary area medially has two dominant nodules .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a wide excision of the malignant melanoma of his right shoulder and partial thickness skin grafting to his right axilla .
The donor site was his right thigh .
He tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A Vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four days .
When this was taken down the graft was noted to be healthy with good take .
It was then dressed with Adaptic and Bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day .
The harvest site was blown dry with a blow dryer .
The patients pain was controlled initially with a PCA and this was eventually discontinued and he was started on Oxycontin .
His Foley was discontinued and a Texas catheter was reapplied .
He was tolerating a regular diet with regular bowel movements with digital rectal stimulation .
He began to work with OT Service .
They began range of motion to his right upper extremity except for around his shoulder .
This was kept to minimal activity .

He , neurologically , was unresponsive and intubated .
He had received both [ ] and Fentanyl for sedation in route to the hospital .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat :
revealed some superficial facial abrasions .
His trachea was midline .
He had a C-collar in place .
His chest wall appeared stable without any crepitus .
He had equal breath sounds on both sides .
His abdomen was flat , scaphoid , and did not appear distended .
He did have some bruising along his anterior abdominal wall as well as a superficial abrasion .
His pelvis was stable upon both AP and Lateral compression .
His examination of his right lower extremity revealed a deformity at his distal thigh .
He had an open laceration over what appeared to be a tib-fib fracture over his leg .
He had obvious fractures in his left hand .
His back exam revealed no stepoff or evidence of spine injury .
His labs were significant for a prothrombin time of 25 , hematocrit of 30 , other labs were unremarkable .
His trauma series revealed a left-sided pulmonary contusion and a wide mediastinum .
Evaluation of the C-spine revealed a C5 fracture .
His pelvis film was normal .
He had films of his right femur which revealed a distal femur fracture as well as a right-sided fibular fracture .
He underwent a head computerized tomography scan which was negative followed by an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan which revealed a left-sided pulmonary contusion .
A small , left-sided pneumothorax .
His abdominal computerized tomography scan revealed a large liver laceration as well as a splenic laceration .
Throughout his stay in the emergency room , his blood pressure was above 90 .
He was tachycardic to 120 .
Because of a persistent volume requirement , he was taken up to the operating room for exploration .

cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated .
He then underwent a resuscitative left thoracotomy and crossclamping of his aorta .
Details of this operation are dictated in a separate note .
We were able to obtain a pulse upon crossclamping of his aorta .
We then performed an abdominal exploration which revealed a large left lobe of liver laceration down to his inferior vena cava .
This was actively bleeding which could not be controlled .
The patient once again lost his pulse and we were unable to come off the aortic crossclamp .
Because of this massive liver injury , this large liver laceration could not be repaired and he was pronounced at 10:15 AM on December 2 , 1998 .
The patient &apos;s family had been notified and they were in route as we proceeded to the operating room .
They have been informed of the turn of events and the demise of their son .

An abdominal wall hernia was also repaired .
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications .
Her postoperative course was unremarkable .
Her vaginal pack was removed on the second postoperative day as well as the Foley catheter .
By postoperative day three she had return of normal bowel function and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty .
Her Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on June 30 , 1994 , postoperative day four .
On that day she was feeling well enough , eating well , and voiding without difficulty .
As a result she was able to be discharged home on June 30 , 1994 .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will follow up with Dr. Top in his office .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Her only additional medication on discharge is Percocet as needed for pain .
In addition Dr. Blincarour from Radiation Oncology saw the patient and recommended pelvic radiation therapy .
She wishes to get her radiation in O and has spoken to her primary care physician regarding this .
Of note the pelvic lymph nodes which were dissected were positive for tumor by frozen section analysis .
The permanent pathology sections are still pending .

CHRONIC MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA , WITHOUT REMISSION ,
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
2/15/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
2/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .
Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .
He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .
He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .
There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .
He had no cardiac murmur .
His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .
The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells .
There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .
The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .
His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .
A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .
There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .
An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained .

DOB :
9/10/67 Mrs. Given is a 31 year old female with a recent history of pneumonia as well as polysubstance abuse , depression , multiple suicide attempts , who actually came to the emergency room after visiting her 51-year-old boyfriend and consuming multiple cardiac medications , in what appears to be a suicide attempt , as well as narcotics .
At about an hour and a half after the patient went home she became quite drowsy , nauseated and threw up .
She fell to the floor , choking on her vomit and was struggling to take a breath .
This was witnessed by her 12 year old daughter , who called the EMT &apos;s .
The EMTs arrived approximately five minutes after the call , found her asystolic and apneic .
They intubated her .
In the field she was given Atropine , Epinephrine and converted to an idioventricular rhythm .
She then persisted to go into EMD and then spontaneously , which is quite unclear , to normal sinus rhythm with a pulse .
Her initial systolic blood pressure was 80 .
The patient was nonresponsive in the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center emergency room. , but her blood pressure was noted to be 105/62 .
In the emergency room she received charcoal and broad speculum antibiotics and Ativan for ? of seizure activity with repetitive mouth movements .
She was evaluated by the Neurological services at that time and felt that these mouth movements might be consistent with hypoxic myoclonus .
She was admitted to our CCU for further therapy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As I have stated is significant for depression , history of crack Cocaine and Heroin use .
She was HIV negative about a year ago .
Kidney stones , chronic back pain , hypertension and multiple suicide attempts .
Her last was with 50 pills of Cardizem CD , as well as obesity .
MEDS AT HOME :

ALLERGIES :
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Her social history is significant for mother who takes care of her twelve-year-old daughter , tobacco , alcohol and multiple polysubstance abuse .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination when she arrived to the Coronary Care Unit was notable for an agitated woman who responds to voice but was very dysarthric .
Her vital signs were temperature of 100.8 , heart rate 96 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations 20 .
Her oxygen saturations were 95% on five liters nasal cannula .
Her pupils were dilated and slightly reactive to light bilaterally and they were anicteric .
Her oropharynx was moist and she had no exudates .
Her neck was supple , she had full range of motion , no thyromegaly , no jugular venous distention and carotids were 2+ without bruits , no lymphadenopathy .
Her lungs were rhonchorous bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm ; she had no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
The abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended .
She had no organomegaly , no flank tenderness .
Her rectal examination was notable for guaiac negative brown stool , good tone .
Extremities :
1+ pulses , no edema , no cords .
Neurological examination :
she was quite somnolent , her deep tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric .
She was spontaneously moving no limbs .
LABORATORY DATA :
The patient had a sodium of 133 , potassium 5.1 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 11.4 , BUN and creatinine 23 and 2.0 .
Calcium 8.0 , phosphorus 9.8 , magnesium 2.4 .
Her albumin was notable at 2.8 .
Her alkaline phosphatase was elevated to 182 and her serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was elevated to 669 as well as lactic acid dehydrogenase to 2,479 .
Her initial arterial blood gases were significant for pO2 of 414 , pCO2 of 28 , and pH of 7.14 on the ventilator .
A beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative .
Her toxicology screen was notable for diazepam , nordiazepam , cyclobenzaprine , Oxycodone , verapamil , cannabinoids , benzodiazepine , opiates on admission .
Her chest x-ray showed bilateral air space disease with a slightly enlarged heart .
An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia when she arrived to the floor .
She had a urinalysis that was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit .
Neurologically , she remained unresponsive until 3-3 , when she became progressively more awake and alert , moving all four extremities .
Her anoxic encephalopathy has improved .
She has been evaluated by our Neurological Services , who feel that per the Levy criteria , she has about a 75% chance of a good recovery with mild to moderate neurological impairment .
She will need much time to recover .
Currently , she improves every day and we are waiting for a magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the presence of watershed cerebral infarcts .
Cardiovascular .
Initially she appeared volume-overloaded with central venous pressure in the 20&apos;s and chest x-rays that were significant for modest to moderate pulmonary edema .
She was diuresed and had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 57% , no segmental wall motion abnormality , and no valvular disease and her rhythms have remained stable in normal sinus rhythm .
Pulmonary .
When she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit , she was on minimal vent settings for airway protection .
As her mental status improved , she became alert enough to be extubated on March 3 .
She has had good oxygenation ever since extubation .
Infectious Disease .
She has grown out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her sputum as well as from a catheter tip .
She has been started on Vancomycin and should receive a two week course .
Therapy was begun on 3-2-99 .
Her blood cultures have remained negative since admission .
She was also noted to be Clostridium difficile positive on her stool and was begun on Flagyl and should continue a seven day course .
Therapy was begun on March 7 .
Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition .

She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .

MRI showed a large heterogenous enhancing right parietal mass lesion with a possible ependymal spread .
The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Service for workup of his tumor .
The neuro-oncologist felt that because of the tremendous tumor burden that was likely causing his symptoms the patient will require open debulking as well as obtaining issue for a pathologic diagnosis .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
None
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .
There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .
She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .
The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .
The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .
Her appetite was gone .
She was having some nausea .
No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .
No changes in her breathing .
She did not seem sleepy or confused .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .
Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .
Temperature 97 .
The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .
She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .
She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .
Her lungs were clear .
heart ; without murmur or gallop .
Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .
soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .
She was moving all four extremities .
Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .
Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .
Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .
She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .
In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .
She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .
The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .
The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .
They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .
By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300&apos;s or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .
On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .
There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .
Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .
She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .
The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .
The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .
The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .
She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.
3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.
4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.
she also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .
5. Metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs PO b.i.d.
6. Calcium acetate ( Phos-Lo ) 667 mgs PO t.i.d.
7. Trazodone 25 mics PO q.h.s.
8. Neurontin 100 mics PO q.h.s.
9. Dilaudid 1-2 mgs PO q6h prn for leg pain .
10. Colace 100 mgs PO t.i.d.
11. Senna two tablets PO b.i.d.
12. Dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs PO b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .
The next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on Wednesday , Oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by November 25 , 2003 .
13. Ranitidine 75 mgs PO b.i.d.
14. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs PO t.i.d.
15. Hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.
16. Furosemide 40 mgs PO b.i.d.
The patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters PO q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .
The patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .
The patient should have an arranged visit to see Dr. Lyn Ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately Friday , Oct 15 , 2003 LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 82-year-old gentleman was admitted on 01/24/02 with stuttering chest pain .
Mr. Kulrinne has a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity .
He had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall .
He was placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .
On medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .
An attempt at medical management was continued .
However , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Blood pressure 112 , Sa02 96% , afebrile .
Lungs clear .
S1 , S2 .
No significant murmurs .
Abdomen :
Obese and soft .
Extremities :
Without edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .
He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .
He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .
He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .
The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .
The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .
Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .
A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .
The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .
The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .
The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .
A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .
His peak CPK was in the 3000 range .
The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .
He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .
In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .
It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .
In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .
Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .
He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .
In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .
The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .
This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .
He tolerated it well .
The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .
The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .
He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .
He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .
At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .
He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .
Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient &apos;s primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall &apos;s office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall &apos;s office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

DIS
Admission Date :
08/18/1996
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
08/23/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PLACENTA PREVIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 33 year old gravida 7 , para 2 , TAB 4 , at 30 and 6/7 weeks on admission with a known complete previa who presented for her second bleeding per vagina today , on the day of admission .
The patient was a PRGH admit on 07/30 , 07/29/96 for first bleeding episode .
She was beta complete during that admission and followed in the special OB Clinic since discharge on 07/31/96 .
The patient had a bleeding episode on 8/9 but told no one and it resolved spontaneously .
On 8/19 , the patient had bleeding per vagina with two pads , denied any abdominal pain or contractions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
MEDICATIONS :
Prenatal vitamins .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
In 1981 , the patient had a TAB in the first trimester .
In 1987 , full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of 6 pound male .
In 1988 , first trimester TAB .
In 1991 , first trimester TAB .
In 1990 , one full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery , 8 pound male .
In 1992 , first trimester TAB .
Current pregnancy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile with stable vital signs .
Fetal heart rate in the 140 range .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , no palpable contractions .
Vaginal pad showed no bleeding .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit of 36.8 .
RH status is positive .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and followed closely on strict bed rest .
Fetal tracing was reassuring .
The patient was beta complete on 08/01 .
Pediatric consult was done during last admission , normal survey , size equal to dates .
The patient was observed on the floor .
On hospital day two , the patient had another small bleed which resolved spontaneously .
There were no contractions .
The baby &apos;s fetal heart tracing was in the 130 range to 140 range , not formally reactive but with great short term and long term variability .
After this episode , there was no further bleeding and after three additional days at bed rest , the patient , against our advice , decided to go home .
A long discussion including Dr. Darlri Kynetlandpryde and the Haenlodstate Medical Center discussed with the patient the risks of leaving the hospital given a complete previa with several known bleeds in the past as well as instability .
The patient understood all risks involved including significant maternal hemorrhage and poor fetal well being .
In spite of these potentially serious risks to her and the baby she felt she wanted to be at home .
We reminded her that even though she lives 15 minutes away , if she stays in the hospital we can act faster to put in an iv , give her fluids and blood , and perform a c / s if necessary than if she has to come in from home and those few minutes can make a difference between a good and bad outcome .
She accepted these risks and opted to be discharged home today .
She has offered that she has plenty of care at home including a housekeeper and will be able to remain on bed rest and live in Arvmelapho and knows to immediately come to the hospital for any bleeding .
She has family members who will be with her at home and will keep the phone number for the ambulance by the phone .
Therefore , the plan was for the patient to be discharged home today on strict bed rest with all precautions given .
The patient will follow-up in one week in the Special OB Clinic .
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included prenatal vitamins .

By the next morning , the patient &apos;s serum glucose level had decreased to less than 400 range , so the patient was covered with the CZI sliding scale .

PM with additional coverage with the CZI sliding scale , however the patient &apos;s fingersticks continued to be in the 300 range , so the patient &apos;s NPH was increased to 70 units subcutaneously q.
